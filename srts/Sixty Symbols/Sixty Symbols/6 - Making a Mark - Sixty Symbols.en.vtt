packed<00:09:51.800><c> up</c><00:09:51.980><c> moved</c><00:09:52.570><c> beside</c><00:09:53.570><c> my</c><00:09:53.750><c> new</c><00:09:53.839><c> job</c><00:09:54.020><c> on</c><00:09:54.140><c> the</c>

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:54.230 align:start position:0%
packed up moved beside my new job on the
 

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.650 align:start position:0%
packed up moved beside my new job on the
3rd<00:09:54.440><c> so</c><00:09:54.980><c> the</c><00:09:55.339><c> whole</c><00:09:55.580><c> point</c><00:09:56.089><c> of</c><00:09:56.180><c> this</c><00:09:56.270><c> job</c><00:09:56.480><c> was</c>

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:56.660 align:start position:0%
3rd so the whole point of this job was
 

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.050 align:start position:0%
3rd so the whole point of this job was
that<00:09:56.870><c> I</c><00:09:57.020><c> wrote</c><00:09:57.589><c> a</c><00:09:57.620><c> proposal</c><00:09:58.100><c> to</c><00:09:58.399><c> say</c><00:09:58.550><c> I</c><00:09:58.790><c> want</c><00:09:59.029><c> to</c>

00:09:59.050 --> 00:09:59.060 align:start position:0%
that I wrote a proposal to say I want to
 

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.180 align:start position:0%
that I wrote a proposal to say I want to
research<00:09:59.360><c> this</c><00:09:59.660><c> and</c><00:09:59.930><c> then</c><00:10:00.290><c> they</c><00:10:00.620><c> picked</c><00:10:00.980><c> it</c>

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:01.190 align:start position:0%
research this and then they picked it
 

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.410 align:start position:0%
research this and then they picked it
because<00:10:01.550><c> they</c><00:10:01.670><c> thought</c><00:10:01.820><c> that's</c><00:10:02.000><c> not</c><00:10:02.089><c> it</c><00:10:02.209><c> cool</c>

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:02.420 align:start position:0%
because they thought that's not it cool
 

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.210 align:start position:0%
because they thought that's not it cool
and<00:10:02.660><c> so</c><00:10:02.930><c> the</c><00:10:03.050><c> research</c><00:10:03.200><c> proposal</c><00:10:03.770><c> is</c><00:10:03.920><c> on</c><00:10:04.070><c> this</c>

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:04.220 align:start position:0%
and so the research proposal is on this
 

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.420 align:start position:0%
and so the research proposal is on this
idea<00:10:04.580><c> of</c><00:10:04.760><c> how</c><00:10:05.390><c> do</c><00:10:06.290><c> black</c><00:10:06.620><c> holes</c><00:10:06.830><c> affect</c><00:10:07.279><c> their</c>

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
galaxies do they stop them from forming
 

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
galaxies do they stop them from forming

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:15.980 align:start position:0%
hole sort of move through the galaxy and
 

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.860 align:start position:0%
hole sort of move through the galaxy and
you<00:10:16.010><c> get</c><00:10:16.190><c> this</c><00:10:16.310><c> sort</c><00:10:16.550><c> of</c><00:10:16.610><c> like</c><00:10:16.820><c> waves</c><00:10:17.149><c> of</c><00:10:17.570><c> sort</c>

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:17.870 align:start position:0%
you get this sort of like waves of sort
 

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.110 align:start position:0%
you get this sort of like waves of sort

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.410 align:start position:0%
surrounding area which then cuts off gas
supplies<00:10:25.339><c> so</c><00:10:25.700><c> there's</c><00:10:25.880><c> no</c><00:10:26.000><c> more</c><00:10:26.149><c> star</c>

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:26.420 align:start position:0%

formation this kind of thing that's what
 

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.650 align:start position:0%
formation this kind of thing that's what
I'm<00:10:28.040><c> going</c><00:10:28.130><c> to</c><00:10:28.190><c> be</c><00:10:28.279><c> focusing</c><00:10:28.670><c> on</c><00:10:28.820><c> I'm</c><00:10:29.330><c> going</c><00:10:29.600><c> to</c>

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:29.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be focusing on I'm going to
 

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be focusing on I'm going to
be<00:10:29.750><c> using</c><00:10:29.899><c> this</c><00:10:30.140><c> really</c><00:10:30.500><c> cool</c><00:10:30.800><c> new</c><00:10:30.980><c> instrument</c>

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:31.490 align:start position:0%
be using this really cool new instrument
 

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.490 align:start position:0%
be using this really cool new instrument
as<00:10:31.640><c> well</c><00:10:31.820><c> it</c><00:10:32.000><c> doesn't</c><00:10:32.180><c> just</c><00:10:32.480><c> take</c><00:10:32.660><c> one</c><00:10:33.200><c> picture</c>

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:33.500 align:start position:0%
as well it doesn't just take one picture
 

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
as well it doesn't just take one picture
of<00:10:33.770><c> a</c><00:10:33.830><c> galaxy</c><00:10:34.070><c> it</c><00:10:34.790><c> takes</c><00:10:35.500><c> 127</c><00:10:36.500><c> little</c><00:10:37.070><c> ones</c><00:10:37.220><c> and</c>

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:37.490 align:start position:0%
of a galaxy it takes 127 little ones and
 

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.060 align:start position:0%
of a galaxy it takes 127 little ones and
so<00:10:38.089><c> you</c><00:10:38.149><c> can</c><00:10:38.420><c> like</c><00:10:38.600><c> like</c><00:10:39.380><c> sort</c><00:10:39.620><c> of</c><00:10:39.650><c> jigsaw</c>

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.070 align:start position:0%
so you can like like sort of jigsaw
 

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.650 align:start position:0%
so you can like like sort of jigsaw
puzzle<00:10:40.430><c> the</c><00:10:40.520><c> galaxies</c><00:10:40.910><c> up</c><00:10:41.029><c> so</c><00:10:41.300><c> that</c><00:10:41.450><c> you</c><00:10:41.510><c> can</c>

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:41.660 align:start position:0%
puzzle the galaxies up so that you can
 

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.420 align:start position:0%
puzzle the galaxies up so that you can
see<00:10:41.839><c> like</c><00:10:42.080><c> what</c><00:10:42.350><c> is</c><00:10:42.470><c> going</c><00:10:42.740><c> on</c><00:10:42.860><c> in</c><00:10:43.100><c> various</c>

I'm<00:10:55.459><c> looking</c><00:10:55.820><c> in</c><00:10:56.029><c> the</c><00:10:56.450><c> optical</c><00:10:56.959><c> and</c><00:10:57.200><c> the</c><00:10:57.350><c> UV</c>

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
I'm looking in the optical and the UV
 

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
I'm looking in the optical and the UV
and<00:10:57.709><c> there's</c><00:10:58.010><c> people</c><00:10:58.160><c> coming</c><00:10:58.279><c> at</c><00:10:58.610><c> it</c><00:10:58.640><c> from</c><00:10:58.850><c> the</c>

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:58.970 align:start position:0%
and there's people coming at it from the
 

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.570 align:start position:0%
and there's people coming at it from the
