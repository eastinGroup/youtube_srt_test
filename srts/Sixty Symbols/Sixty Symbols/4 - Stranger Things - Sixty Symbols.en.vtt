00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 align:start position:0%
a message to his mom yeah basically and
 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.310 align:start position:0%
a message to his mom yeah basically and
so<00:00:51.690><c> I</c><00:00:52.049><c> was</c><00:00:52.589><c> thinking</c><00:00:53.010><c> as</c><00:00:53.339><c> a</c><00:00:53.400><c> physicist</c><00:00:54.140><c> how</c><00:00:55.140><c> is</c>

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
so I was thinking as a physicist how is
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.990 align:start position:0%
so I was thinking as a physicist how is
this<00:00:55.440><c> even</c><00:00:55.710><c> possible</c><00:00:55.739><c> how</c><00:00:56.640><c> does</c><00:00:56.879><c> one</c>

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
this even possible how does one
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 align:start position:0%
this even possible how does one
communicate<00:00:57.180><c> from</c><00:00:57.900><c> a</c><00:00:58.110><c> whole</c><00:00:58.379><c> other</c><00:00:58.739><c> universe</c>

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
communicate from a whole other universe
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.509 align:start position:0%
communicate from a whole other universe
to<00:01:00.239><c> our</c><00:01:00.390><c> universe</c><00:01:00.780><c> in</c><00:01:01.110><c> 1983</c><00:01:03.710><c> and</c><00:01:04.710><c> so</c><00:01:05.250><c> I've</c><00:01:05.400><c> come</c>

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 align:start position:0%
to our universe in 1983 and so I've come
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.490 align:start position:0%
to our universe in 1983 and so I've come
up<00:01:05.610><c> with</c><00:01:05.640><c> this</c><00:01:05.820><c> theory</c><00:01:06.150><c> this</c><00:01:06.390><c> physics</c><00:01:06.990><c> fan</c>

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
up with this theory this physics fan
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.390 align:start position:0%
up with this theory this physics fan
theory<00:01:07.909><c> and</c><00:01:08.909><c> I</c><00:01:09.060><c> think</c><00:01:09.570><c> that</c><00:01:10.439><c> this</c><00:01:10.710><c> is</c><00:01:10.890><c> possible</c>

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
theory and I think that this is possible
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
theory and I think that this is possible

hold one in either hand when I say to
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.260 align:start position:0%
hold one in either hand when I say to
you<00:01:44.009><c> you</c><00:01:44.100><c> know</c><00:01:44.219><c> which</c><00:01:44.490><c> one</c><00:01:44.729><c> is</c><00:01:44.880><c> the</c><00:01:44.999><c> red</c><00:01:45.119><c> ball</c>

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 align:start position:0%
you you know which one is the red ball
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.940 align:start position:0%
you you know which one is the red ball
and<00:01:45.299><c> which</c><00:01:45.479><c> one</c><00:01:45.630><c> is</c><00:01:45.719><c> the</c><00:01:45.840><c> blue</c><00:01:45.990><c> ball</c><00:01:46.170><c> we</c><00:01:46.740><c> know</c>

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 align:start position:0%
and which one is the blue ball we know
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.499 align:start position:0%
and which one is the blue ball we know
that<00:01:47.219><c> one</c><00:01:47.460><c> of</c><00:01:47.579><c> them</c><00:01:47.670><c> is</c><00:01:47.789><c> definitely</c><00:01:47.969><c> red</c><00:01:48.359><c> and</c>

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 align:start position:0%
that one of them is definitely red and
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 align:start position:0%
that one of them is definitely red and
one<00:01:48.630><c> of</c><00:01:48.689><c> them</c><00:01:48.780><c> is</c><00:01:48.869><c> definitely</c><00:01:48.990><c> blue</c><00:01:49.380><c> and</c><00:01:49.649><c> so</c>

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 align:start position:0%
one of them is definitely blue and so
 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.469 align:start position:0%
one of them is definitely blue and so
it's<00:01:50.130><c> only</c><00:01:50.219><c> when</c><00:01:50.429><c> I</c><00:01:50.460><c> open</c><00:01:50.909><c> my</c><00:01:50.969><c> hand</c><00:01:51.090><c> and</c><00:01:51.389><c> say</c>

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
it's only when I open my hand and say
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.669 align:start position:0%
it's only when I open my hand and say
okay<00:01:51.689><c> that</c><00:01:51.869><c> was</c><00:01:51.990><c> the</c><00:01:52.079><c> blue</c><00:01:52.229><c> ball</c><00:01:52.409><c> and</c><00:01:52.560><c> there</c>

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
okay that was the blue ball and there
 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.109 align:start position:0%
okay that was the blue ball and there
was<00:01:52.770><c> the</c><00:01:52.889><c> red</c><00:01:53.039><c> ball</c><00:01:53.219><c> that</c><00:01:53.609><c> we</c><00:01:53.700><c> knew</c><00:01:53.819><c> all</c><00:01:53.969><c> along</c>

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
was the red ball that we knew all along
 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.899 align:start position:0%
was the red ball that we knew all along
that<00:01:54.270><c> this</c><00:01:54.539><c> was</c><00:01:54.749><c> blue</c><00:01:54.960><c> and</c><00:01:55.259><c> this</c><00:01:55.469><c> was</c><00:01:55.679><c> red</c><00:01:55.909><c> but</c>

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 align:start position:0%
that this was blue and this was red but
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.340 align:start position:0%
that this was blue and this was red but
one<00:01:57.149><c> of</c><00:01:57.179><c> them</c><00:01:57.359><c> is</c><00:01:57.509><c> always</c><00:01:57.689><c> blue</c><00:01:58.020><c> and</c><00:01:58.170><c> one</c><00:01:58.259><c> of</c>

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 align:start position:0%
one of them is always blue and one of
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.679 align:start position:0%
one of them is always blue and one of
them<00:01:58.439><c> is</c><00:01:58.530><c> always</c><00:01:58.679><c> red</c><00:01:58.889><c> if</c><00:01:59.490><c> this</c><00:02:00.389><c> was</c><00:02:00.569><c> the</c>

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 align:start position:0%
them is always red if this was the
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.929 align:start position:0%
them is always red if this was the
quantum<00:02:01.109><c> world</c><00:02:01.259><c> and</c><00:02:01.649><c> you</c><00:02:02.340><c> couldn't</c><00:02:02.670><c> tell</c>

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 align:start position:0%
quantum world and you couldn't tell
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.809 align:start position:0%
quantum world and you couldn't tell
which<00:02:03.450><c> one</c><00:02:03.600><c> was</c><00:02:03.719><c> red</c><00:02:03.899><c> or</c><00:02:04.049><c> which</c><00:02:04.139><c> was</c><00:02:04.319><c> blue</c><00:02:04.819><c> they</c>

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
which one was red or which was blue they
 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
which one was red or which was blue they
would<00:02:06.060><c> both</c><00:02:06.329><c> be</c><00:02:07.049><c> red</c><00:02:07.289><c> and</c><00:02:07.439><c> blue</c><00:02:07.649><c> at</c><00:02:08.190><c> the</c><00:02:08.280><c> same</c>

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 align:start position:0%
would both be red and blue at the same
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.790 align:start position:0%
would both be red and blue at the same
time<00:02:08.880><c> so</c><00:02:09.780><c> this</c><00:02:09.869><c> is</c><00:02:10.020><c> like</c><00:02:10.170><c> the</c><00:02:10.380><c> Schrodinger's</c>

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
time so this is like the Schrodinger's
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.530 align:start position:0%
time so this is like the Schrodinger's
cat<00:02:11.009><c> example</c><00:02:11.580><c> the</c><00:02:11.670><c> cat</c><00:02:11.819><c> is</c><00:02:11.970><c> both</c><00:02:12.120><c> dead</c><00:02:12.390><c> and</c>

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
cat example the cat is both dead and
 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
cat example the cat is both dead and
alive<00:02:12.720><c> at</c><00:02:13.200><c> the</c><00:02:13.290><c> same</c><00:02:13.470><c> time</c><00:02:15.560><c> yes</c><00:02:17.480><c> so</c><00:02:18.480><c> there's</c>

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 align:start position:0%
alive at the same time yes so there's
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.780 align:start position:0%
alive at the same time yes so there's
some<00:02:18.810><c> sort</c><00:02:19.020><c> of</c><00:02:19.050><c> weird</c><00:02:19.319><c> linear</c><00:02:19.830><c> superposition</c>

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 align:start position:0%
some sort of weird linear superposition
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 align:start position:0%
of red and blue in the quantum world and
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.220 align:start position:0%
of red and blue in the quantum world and
it's<00:02:23.370><c> only</c><00:02:23.550><c> when</c><00:02:23.760><c> we</c><00:02:24.120><c> again</c><00:02:24.450><c> we</c><00:02:24.630><c> open</c><00:02:24.930><c> the</c><00:02:24.990><c> hand</c>

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 align:start position:0%
it's only when we again we open the hand
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's only when we again we open the hand
and<00:02:25.560><c> we</c><00:02:25.650><c> see</c><00:02:25.800><c> that</c><00:02:25.920><c> this</c><00:02:26.040><c> one</c><00:02:26.220><c> is</c><00:02:26.250><c> blue</c><00:02:26.519><c> that</c><00:02:26.549><c> we</c>

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 align:start position:0%
and we see that this one is blue that we
 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
and we see that this one is blue that we
know<00:02:26.849><c> this</c><00:02:26.970><c> one</c><00:02:27.150><c> it's</c><00:02:27.299><c> red</c><00:02:27.450><c> but</c><00:02:27.780><c> before</c><00:02:28.080><c> that</c>

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 align:start position:0%
know this one it's red but before that
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.050 align:start position:0%
know this one it's red but before that
they<00:02:28.739><c> were</c><00:02:28.830><c> both</c><00:02:28.980><c> so</c><00:02:29.519><c> if</c><00:02:29.580><c> we</c><00:02:29.670><c> have</c><00:02:29.790><c> two</c>

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
they were both so if we have two
 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
they were both so if we have two
quantumly<00:02:30.780><c> and</c><00:02:31.019><c> tangle</c>

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 align:start position:0%

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 align:start position:0%
any properties so what I was doing there
 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
any properties so what I was doing there
was<00:02:36.600><c> this</c><00:02:37.110><c> color</c><00:02:37.380><c> was</c><00:02:37.680><c> an</c><00:02:37.830><c> analogy</c><00:02:38.340><c> for</c>

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 align:start position:0%
was this color was an analogy for
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
was this color was an analogy for
spittin<00:02:39.600><c> basically</c><00:02:40.290><c> or</c><00:02:40.440><c> some</c><00:02:40.709><c> property</c><00:02:41.280><c> of</c>

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 align:start position:0%
spittin basically or some property of
 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.370 align:start position:0%
spittin basically or some property of
the<00:02:41.459><c> particle</c><00:02:41.670><c> so</c><00:02:42.090><c> spin</c><00:02:42.480><c> up</c><00:02:42.720><c> and</c><00:02:43.020><c> spin</c><00:02:43.050><c> down</c>

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
the particle so spin up and spin down
 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.860 align:start position:0%
the particle so spin up and spin down
and<00:02:43.950><c> that</c><00:02:44.310><c> is</c><00:02:44.430><c> a</c><00:02:44.459><c> very</c><00:02:44.970><c> fundamental</c><00:02:45.240><c> property</c>

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 align:start position:0%
and that is a very fundamental property
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.070 align:start position:0%
and that is a very fundamental property
of<00:02:45.900><c> particles</c><00:02:46.440><c> and</c><00:02:46.860><c> so</c><00:02:47.010><c> if</c><00:02:47.220><c> we</c><00:02:47.400><c> have</c><00:02:47.580><c> these</c>

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
of particles and so if we have these
 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.750 align:start position:0%
of particles and so if we have these
quantumly<00:02:49.080><c> entangled</c><00:02:49.620><c> particles</c><00:02:50.100><c> they</c><00:02:50.610><c> don't</c>

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
quantumly entangled particles they don't
 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.059 align:start position:0%
quantumly entangled particles they don't

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 align:start position:0%
have any spin yet they do have spin it's
 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
have any spin yet they do have spin it's
just<00:02:53.310><c> that</c><00:02:53.430><c> you</c><00:02:53.550><c> can't</c><00:02:53.850><c> describe</c><00:02:54.420><c> one</c><00:02:55.110><c> without</c>
