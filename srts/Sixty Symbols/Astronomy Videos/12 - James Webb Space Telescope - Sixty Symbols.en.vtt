00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 align:start position:0%
be orbiting further around it will be
 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.179 align:start position:0%
be orbiting further around it will be

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 align:start position:0%
launched an Ariane 5 which is a really
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.720 align:start position:0%

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 align:start position:0%
really successful ISA rocket
 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.250 align:start position:0%
really successful ISA rocket
I'd<00:01:38.730><c> imagine</c><00:01:38.910><c> a</c><00:01:39.150><c> physical</c><00:01:39.660><c> dose</c><00:01:41.840><c> and</c><00:01:42.840><c> then</c>

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'd imagine a physical dose and then
 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
I'd imagine a physical dose and then
they're<00:01:43.380><c> going</c><00:01:43.470><c> to</c><00:01:43.530><c> give</c><00:01:43.650><c> it</c><00:01:43.770><c> a</c><00:01:43.860><c> little</c><00:01:44.100><c> bit</c>

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 align:start position:0%
they're going to give it a little bit
 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.550 align:start position:0%
they're going to give it a little bit
and<00:01:44.670><c> then</c><00:01:45.120><c> I'll</c><00:01:45.240><c> get</c><00:01:45.360><c> it</c><00:01:45.540><c> get</c><00:01:45.930><c> it</c><00:01:46.140><c> enough</c>

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
and then I'll get it get it enough
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
and then I'll get it get it enough
energy<00:01:46.800><c> to</c><00:01:47.250><c> get</c><00:01:47.550><c> to</c><00:01:47.610><c> l2</c><00:01:48.560><c> but</c><00:01:49.560><c> really</c><00:01:49.830><c> really</c>

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 align:start position:0%
energy to get to l2 but really really
 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
energy to get to l2 but really really
slowly<00:01:50.220><c> so</c><00:01:51.060><c> what</c><00:01:51.180><c> they'll</c><00:01:51.300><c> do</c><00:01:51.390><c> is</c><00:01:51.420><c> it's</c><00:01:51.930><c> kind</c>

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 align:start position:0%
slowly so what they'll do is it's kind
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.870 align:start position:0%
slowly so what they'll do is it's kind
of<00:01:52.200><c> like</c><00:01:52.380><c> going</c><00:01:52.620><c> up</c><00:01:52.710><c> a</c><00:01:52.770><c> hill</c><00:01:52.950><c> if</c><00:01:53.280><c> you</c><00:01:53.610><c> will</c><00:01:53.729><c> so</c>

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
of like going up a hill if you will so
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.310 align:start position:0%
of like going up a hill if you will so
they'll<00:01:54.030><c> give</c><00:01:54.180><c> it</c><00:01:54.210><c> enough</c><00:01:54.660><c> energy</c><00:01:54.810><c> to</c><00:01:55.020><c> boost</c>

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
they'll give it enough energy to boost
 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.690 align:start position:0%
they'll give it enough energy to boost
it<00:01:55.470><c> up</c><00:01:55.500><c> the</c><00:01:55.620><c> hill</c><00:01:55.770><c> but</c><00:01:55.979><c> so</c><00:01:56.190><c> much</c><00:01:56.340><c> so</c><00:01:56.460><c> it</c><00:01:56.580><c> will</c>

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
it up the hill but so much so it will
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.219 align:start position:0%
it up the hill but so much so it will
slow<00:01:56.910><c> down</c><00:01:56.940><c> so</c><00:01:57.180><c> don't</c><00:01:57.240><c> announce</c><00:01:57.690><c> down</c><00:01:57.960><c> until</c>

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 align:start position:0%
slow down so don't announce down until
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.719 align:start position:0%
slow down so don't announce down until
it<00:01:58.290><c> reaches</c><00:01:58.590><c> the</c><00:01:58.619><c> very</c><00:01:58.800><c> top</c><00:01:59.070><c> at</c><00:01:59.369><c> which</c><00:01:59.490><c> point</c>

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 align:start position:0%
it reaches the very top at which point
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.820 align:start position:0%
it reaches the very top at which point
it<00:01:59.790><c> will</c><00:01:59.880><c> stop</c><00:02:00.150><c> and</c><00:02:00.750><c> the</c><00:02:01.260><c> thing</c><00:02:01.440><c> is</c><00:02:01.590><c> was</c><00:02:01.800><c> a</c>

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 align:start position:0%
it will stop and the thing is was a
 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.010 align:start position:0%
it will stop and the thing is was a
really<00:02:02.070><c> good</c><00:02:02.220><c> plus</c><00:02:02.490><c> yeah</c><00:02:03.180><c> like</c><00:02:03.540><c> a</c><00:02:03.570><c> really</c>

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
really good plus yeah like a really
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
really good plus yeah like a really

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 align:start position:0%
really good putt yes that just sort of
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.180 align:start position:0%
really good putt yes that just sort of
stopped<00:02:06.750><c> threatening</c><00:02:07.140><c> a</c><00:02:07.170><c> German</c><00:02:07.470><c> folding</c><00:02:07.770><c> in</c>

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 align:start position:0%
stopped threatening a German folding in
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.030 align:start position:0%
stopped threatening a German folding in
that<00:02:08.459><c> time</c><00:02:08.700><c> the</c><00:02:09.570><c> antenna</c><00:02:10.290><c> will</c><00:02:10.470><c> fold</c><00:02:10.649><c> out</c><00:02:10.800><c> so</c>

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
that time the antenna will fold out so
 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.590 align:start position:0%
that time the antenna will fold out so
it<00:02:11.100><c> can</c><00:02:11.160><c> talk</c><00:02:11.280><c> to</c><00:02:11.430><c> earth</c><00:02:11.580><c> and</c><00:02:11.730><c> then</c><00:02:12.239><c> the</c><00:02:12.360><c> whole</c>

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
it can talk to earth and then the whole
 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.350 align:start position:0%
it can talk to earth and then the whole
