we're going to start with a few

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:31.460 align:start position:0%
questions now so Katrina what is the
 

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
questions now so Katrina what is the

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.340 align:start position:0%
but I think that when the formula is

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:52.350 align:start position:0%
written down on the page it's then much

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
