the<00:03:31.360><c> water</c><00:03:31.680><c> can</c><00:03:31.920><c> melt</c><00:03:32.640><c> the</c><00:03:32.799><c> pipe</c><00:03:33.200><c> make</c><00:03:33.440><c> it</c>

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
the water can melt the pipe make it

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.030 align:start position:0%

it<00:03:37.040><c> can</c><00:03:37.200><c> also</c><00:03:37.519><c> freeze</c><00:03:37.840><c> to</c><00:03:38.080><c> the</c><00:03:38.159><c> walls</c><00:03:38.560><c> which</c>

it can also freeze to the walls which
 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.630 align:start position:0%
it can also freeze to the walls which

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
makes the walls shrink
 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.270 align:start position:0%
makes the walls shrink
so<00:03:40.879><c> it's</c><00:03:41.120><c> actually</c><00:03:41.440><c> a</c><00:03:41.920><c> quite</c><00:03:42.159><c> mathematical</c>

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.030 align:start position:0%
so the idea is can we somehow

the way you would do this is by
