 most point that if you have research that wheelie driven by

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.630
 curiosity at the Diep not to understand you make up progress

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.310
 that is incredibly effective and know your transforma world

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.160
 and a few aural that three that can be mythical or major changes

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.399
 June gift of intellect and a drive this week finds us the the just

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.020
 wanted to know yes and all ernie samples

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.600
 so jcj magnetic in this there is a huntingtin heart is creative intellect

 what a family can do the least

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.780
 of the half hour the force was nobel prize winner and i make a list of

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.930
 mathematicians who have i made the nation so interest

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.590
 in the arts and not bios with a shirt category with

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.260
 mathematicians with too much imagination interest in any foil and edgy machine

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.380
 look at that you read from your de leibniz de card holder great names

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.900
 so when i put this kind of ramp and tanks around there that seems so far families was out of it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.580
 I at those astronomers la course there i must be happy railway is being forgotten

 planet weiss cinder also assisted in psychology

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.100
 or on chemistry and in the you can make all

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.530
 out or don't leave it soft particle accelerator

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.990
 understanding henex two profile of michael foger the rescue and cost me see

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.829
 falls in that the mansion in this is copying electricity and and that you crisis

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.130
 the model electricité this discomfort and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.259
 application of is best the site they all of us with a totally useless and further

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.130

 tell that trillion gladstone how that point was the chancellor of the exchequer

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.390
 came to visit him in this life and has no way what is the will good for

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.490
 and michael faraday set has noah who have it

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.530
 one day tex you may texas and goodness leave it to go soon actually he should ca

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.170

 farida and maxwell's equations 11 electromagnetic

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.730
 they would both be a few thousand what was sending me all the wonderful

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.970
 thing of that plain early stages of the developer

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.960
 magnetism is of course we maxels realization that action is describing

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.110
 lights that their sister is simple set of equations

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.420
 the easy fit under t shirt but the squire just o'neill ipad air of your shape or we

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.100
 electromagnet radiation so in sometimes and so you look at rainbow 'that you then

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.390
 realize the electromagnetic spectrum we chose among the metro mediawise

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.250
 short to express solis is incredible unification or on

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.080
 for years so possible in both simple i pointed him has oil blend it

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.040
 patented betty grace and digi must can be peeping there

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.410
 infinity 'of all basic research and world and that you

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.810
 you can make that point that in some sense is many technological innovations

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.410
 30 course image radio image half is a signals

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.470
 cloak vejle tetra with f-mex wouldn't have been able to go or

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.850
 synthesize the work of faraday and address and in this very simple wit and any form

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.780
 blunting beauty eyes mexx locations or just lovely you have to

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.220
 fake weapons something like it is park that left me so dead for the most famous

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.020
 disco race that gives you semblance of curiosity the workshop einstein there is vwo

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.850
 and relativity and this in a most people's hw-p rw life

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.210
 just how and brother to pick up spot abilities to my

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.050
 so einstein's daily life we ​​could have a fresh one

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.020
 look at space and time and think before einstein

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.610
 space was always like on which everything happens and time was

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.680
 to your on time the was ashen clock choking and danny showtec damsel

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.540
 coincidence that the sting is long flexible this particular scent the devi put

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.470
 something like yours in space this color spacing fact it us

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.150
 also first so time at self which would think and universal are something

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.490
 to paisley everybody you are moving wired oslo you heavy oh a clock and all that

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.740
 old friend's clubs a hundred years ago which is where my now matched perfectly

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.110
 small to directly manager with close did in high tech world that is

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.199
 can or my percent demeter and friend are sarge eps system which are using

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.430
 satellite sorbet in joris that cost jar moving in the gravitational field and

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.910
 the moving the high-speed einstein's questions and grab you

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.580
 haven't is a with eyes think life story to give michael secans in the translates

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.979
 drums of fuji ps of light seven miles the dough i don't like that

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.900
 alac to say we there einstein already ruby ​​last mother goes with her with us

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.560
 hug and dogs effects beautiful thing is that

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.070
 einstein's equation it self he knows fits easily

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:57.599
 under t shirt and so the size is able to capture all this into simple and revue

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.010
 the page look like a ripoli hooray is the curver trio space and time

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.770
 and be matter and energy efficient in the universal

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.900
 here none was able to capture or that philosophical thinking did the practicals

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.080
 applications in the single line UK government night life lines criteria

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.110
 jig hold the wasco perious if it's all that i

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.770
 and so we practice like to point out and through mathematical grace your sign is one

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.319
 layer einstein's gracious for mixture in the day look like ae coli and the must

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.800
 important part in the question is really good i-frame

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.449
 i want to say something relating to things that you do this as often as you lead it

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.919
 I seem to risk and scene square and most famous I point and fishermen

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.999
 it ill discharge energy and mesh who for einstein is true itself the concept

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:57.569
 with picasa putin monique girl thirty icon looked with a cry and the old bold

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:02.819
 like in a new explosion or in fogg energy like a moving mine

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.639
 brass crisis like button million for percent with

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:10.830
 silent day and so the scroll of mathematics and icing

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.060
 connecting concept connecting a ds connecting people is a

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.020
 family half as cunning disciple his recapture family

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.610
 the essence of mathematics and wanting depends on whether so very funny thing that i am

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.710
 almost two de d century art rug is discovery of the feel

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.189
 the passions midi tact it here gravitational-wave

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:37.889
 and this also shows that some of these loans on research effort

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:42.719
 they take more in a single lingers my einstein passed away

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:48.749
 in 1915 five you see who you were celebrated and she is piece of art and that's

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:53.610
 like to first thing to say je begin het was beautiful philosophical

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:58.999
 budget and applications and off course there is room again
