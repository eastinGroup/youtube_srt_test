so he went on when he was about 16
because<00:01:21.360><c> he</c><00:01:21.600><c> was</c><00:01:21.759><c> big</c><00:01:22.000><c> into</c><00:01:22.240><c> scrabble</c>

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
and it really got me interested in maths
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.710 align:start position:0%
and it really got me interested in maths
and<00:02:21.520><c> numbers</c>

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
and numbers
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.550 align:start position:0%
and numbers
and<00:02:22.959><c> um</c><00:02:23.280><c> even</c><00:02:23.520><c> the</c><00:02:23.680><c> letter</c><00:02:24.000><c> side</c><00:02:24.239><c> is</c><00:02:24.400><c> quite</c>

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
and um even the letter side is quite

and um even the letter side is quite
mathematical<00:02:25.280><c> with</c><00:02:25.360><c> the</c><00:02:25.440><c> way</c>

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
mathematical with the way
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.670 align:start position:0%
mathematical with the way
all<00:02:26.239><c> uh</c><00:02:26.480><c> all</c><00:02:26.640><c> the</c><00:02:26.720><c> anagrams</c><00:02:27.200><c> the</c><00:02:27.280><c> way</c><00:02:27.440><c> it</c><00:02:27.599><c> all</c>

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
all uh all the anagrams the way it all
 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.589 align:start position:0%
all uh all the anagrams the way it all
works<00:02:28.000><c> together</c><00:02:28.560><c> um</c>

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
works together um
 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.350 align:start position:0%
works together um
so<00:02:29.760><c> it</c><00:02:29.840><c> really</c><00:02:30.080><c> really</c><00:02:30.400><c> sort</c><00:02:30.560><c> of</c><00:02:30.879><c> peaked</c><00:02:31.200><c> my</c>

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
so it really really sort of peaked my
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.710 align:start position:0%
so it really really sort of peaked my
interest<00:02:31.760><c> for</c><00:02:32.000><c> um</c>

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 align:start position:0%

yeah and then that's already three
 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.070 align:start position:0%
yeah and then that's already three
letters<00:03:23.120><c> so</c><00:03:23.280><c> all</c><00:03:23.440><c> you're</c><00:03:23.519><c> doing</c><00:03:23.760><c> is</c><00:03:23.840><c> looking</c>

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
letters so all you're doing is looking
 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.750 align:start position:0%
letters so all you're doing is looking
for<00:03:24.560><c> shorter</c><00:03:24.799><c> letters</c><00:03:25.040><c> in</c><00:03:25.120><c> the</c><00:03:25.200><c> rest</c><00:03:25.440><c> of</c><00:03:25.519><c> the</c>

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
for shorter letters in the rest of the
 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.630 align:start position:0%
for shorter letters in the rest of the
words

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
words
 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.670 align:start position:0%
words
um<00:03:28.080><c> and</c><00:03:28.319><c> so</c><00:03:28.480><c> it's</c><00:03:28.640><c> little</c><00:03:28.799><c> things</c><00:03:29.040><c> like</c><00:03:29.200><c> that</c>

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
um and so it's little things like that
 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.270 align:start position:0%
um and so it's little things like that
um<00:03:30.560><c> common</c><00:03:31.280><c> common</c><00:03:31.599><c> starting</c><00:03:32.000><c> common</c><00:03:32.319><c> endings</c>

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
um common common starting common endings
 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.630 align:start position:0%
um common common starting common endings
and<00:03:33.519><c> then</c><00:03:34.879><c> i'd</c><00:03:35.040><c> always</c><00:03:35.360><c> start</c><00:03:35.840><c> low</c><00:03:36.239><c> so</c>

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
and then i'd always start low so
 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.990 align:start position:0%
and then i'd always start low so
the<00:03:36.799><c> first</c><00:03:37.040><c> word</c><00:03:37.280><c> you</c><00:03:37.360><c> see</c><00:03:37.519><c> whatever</c><00:03:37.760><c> it</c><00:03:37.920><c> is</c>

letters in that order on the board so
 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.430 align:start position:0%
letters in that order on the board so
one<00:04:34.400><c> are</c><00:04:34.479><c> writing</c><00:04:34.720><c> down</c><00:04:34.880><c> a</c><00:04:34.960><c> different</c><00:04:35.120><c> order</c>

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
birthday so that would have been
 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.710 align:start position:0%
birthday so that would have been
in<00:06:24.080><c> 2012</c><00:06:24.880><c> and</c><00:06:25.039><c> i</c><00:06:25.199><c> lost</c><00:06:25.759><c> my</c><00:06:25.919><c> first</c><00:06:26.240><c> show</c><00:06:26.400><c> again</c>

on that
 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.070 align:start position:0%

well i mean they're just i guess lots of
 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.430 align:start position:0%
well i mean they're just i guess lots of
different<00:06:58.560><c> ways</c><00:06:58.720><c> to</c><00:06:58.800><c> approach</c><00:06:59.039><c> it</c><00:06:59.120><c> with</c><00:06:59.280><c> lots</c>

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.469 align:start position:0%
of different so
for<00:07:00.319><c> example</c><00:07:01.280><c> we</c><00:07:01.440><c> had</c><00:07:01.520><c> one</c><00:07:01.759><c> with</c><00:07:01.919><c> six</c><00:07:02.160><c> from</c><00:07:02.240><c> the</c>

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
six small numbers yeah
 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.510 align:start position:0%
six small numbers yeah
and<00:07:04.400><c> trying</c><00:07:04.560><c> to</c><00:07:04.639><c> work</c><00:07:04.800><c> that</c><00:07:04.880><c> one</c><00:07:05.039><c> out</c><00:07:05.199><c> feels</c>

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
and trying to work that one out feels

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
really different to trying to work out
 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.150 align:start position:0%

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
one with four big numbers
 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.390 align:start position:0%

it's<00:07:14.639><c> just</c><00:07:14.800><c> first</c><00:07:15.039><c> a</c><00:07:15.120><c> challenge</c><00:07:15.360><c> just</c><00:07:15.440><c> to</c><00:07:15.520><c> get</c>

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you can find a way to multiply
 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.309 align:start position:0%
maybe you can find a way to multiply
four<00:07:21.680><c> numbers</c><00:07:21.919><c> together</c>

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
four numbers together
 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.070 align:start position:0%

it's<00:07:22.479><c> kind</c><00:07:22.560><c> of</c><00:07:22.720><c> close</c><00:07:23.360><c> and</c><00:07:23.440><c> then</c><00:07:23.599><c> you</c><00:07:23.759><c> can</c><00:07:23.919><c> try</c>

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of close and then you can try
 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.749 align:start position:0%
it's kind of close and then you can try
and<00:07:24.160><c> adjust</c><00:07:24.560><c> a</c><00:07:24.639><c> little</c><00:07:24.800><c> bit</c>

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
and adjust a little bit
 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.670 align:start position:0%
and adjust a little bit
um<00:07:26.240><c> whereas</c><00:07:26.560><c> i</c><00:07:26.639><c> think</c><00:07:26.800><c> with</c><00:07:27.199><c> the</c><00:07:27.360><c> four</c><00:07:27.520><c> big</c>

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
um whereas i think with the four big
 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.430 align:start position:0%
um whereas i think with the four big
numbers<00:07:28.000><c> maybe</c><00:07:28.240><c> there</c><00:07:28.400><c> are</c><00:07:28.560><c> more</c>

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
numbers maybe there are more

kind of strategies for them yeah i think
 

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
kind of strategies for them yeah i think
a<00:07:52.720><c> bit</c><00:07:52.879><c> yeah</c><00:07:53.039><c> you</c><00:07:53.199><c> know</c><00:07:53.360><c> i</c><00:07:53.440><c> mean</c>

a bit yeah you know i mean
 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.430 align:start position:0%
a bit yeah you know i mean
there<00:07:54.240><c> are</c><00:07:54.560><c> there</c><00:07:54.720><c> are</c><00:07:54.879><c> definitely</c><00:07:55.199><c> some</c>

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
things like for you you can work out
 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.550 align:start position:0%
things like for you you can work out
what<00:07:57.599><c> you</c><00:07:57.680><c> can</c><00:07:57.759><c> get</c><00:07:57.919><c> which</c><00:07:58.080><c> is</c><00:07:58.160><c> those</c><00:07:58.400><c> four</c>

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
what you can get which is those four
 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.070 align:start position:0%
what you can get which is those four
numbers<00:07:58.800><c> alone</c><00:07:59.039><c> for</c><00:07:59.120><c> example</c><00:07:59.440><c> oh</c><00:07:59.599><c> really</c>

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
that down into a

that down into a

series of steps you're like okay
actually<00:09:11.839><c> you</c><00:09:11.920><c> could</c><00:09:12.160><c> have</c><00:09:12.240><c> thought</c><00:09:12.399><c> that</c><00:09:12.560><c> up</c>

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
actually you could have thought that up
 

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.150 align:start position:0%
actually you could have thought that up
in<00:09:12.800><c> advance</c><00:09:13.200><c> and</c><00:09:13.360><c> it</c><00:09:13.440><c> helps</c><00:09:13.680><c> you</c><00:09:13.839><c> then</c><00:09:14.000><c> for</c>

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
the 75 tables the 25 tables i think it's
 

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:14.550 align:start position:0%
the 75 tables the 25 tables i think it's
just<00:10:14.000><c> most</c>

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
just most

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
mostly repeated exposure yeah um if you
 

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.230 align:start position:0%
mostly repeated exposure yeah um if you
watch<00:10:17.360><c> countdown</c><00:10:17.760><c> enough</c>

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%

but i mean definitely for me at the time
it<00:10:22.959><c> went</c><00:10:23.200><c> on</c><00:10:23.440><c> i</c><00:10:23.600><c> would</c><00:10:23.680><c> not</c><00:10:23.839><c> have</c><00:10:24.160><c> thought</c>

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
it went on i would not have thought
 

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.829 align:start position:0%
it went on i would not have thought
a<00:10:24.720><c> millisecond</c><00:10:25.279><c> about</c><00:10:25.920><c> 13</c><00:10:26.240><c> times</c><00:10:26.399><c> 75.</c>

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.230 align:start position:0%
process that i didn't used to have to go
through<00:10:33.440><c> there</c><00:10:33.680><c> so</c><00:10:33.839><c> it</c><00:10:33.839><c> wasn't</c>

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
through there so it wasn't
 

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.230 align:start position:0%
through there so it wasn't
too<00:10:34.399><c> rusty</c><00:10:34.720><c> now</c><00:10:34.959><c> so</c><00:10:35.120><c> it's</c><00:10:35.279><c> automated</c><00:10:35.839><c> then</c>

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
too rusty now so it's automated then
 

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.670 align:start position:0%
too rusty now so it's automated then
that<00:10:36.480><c> those</c><00:10:36.800><c> things</c><00:10:37.040><c> some</c><00:10:37.200><c> of</c><00:10:37.279><c> those</c><00:10:37.440><c> things</c>

yeah yeah right okay and that's really
interesting<00:10:41.360><c> because</c><00:10:41.519><c> i</c><00:10:41.600><c> think</c><00:10:42.000><c> um</c>

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
interesting because i think um
 

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.509 align:start position:0%
interesting because i think um
for<00:10:42.800><c> our</c><00:10:42.959><c> students</c><00:10:44.560><c> they</c><00:10:44.720><c> often</c><00:10:44.959><c> say</c><00:10:45.120><c> ours</c><00:10:45.440><c> you</c>

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
for our students they often say ours you
 

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:46.790 align:start position:0%
for our students they often say ours you
know<00:10:45.680><c> we</c><00:10:45.760><c> want</c><00:10:45.920><c> to</c><00:10:46.000><c> be</c><00:10:46.079><c> creative</c><00:10:46.480><c> with</c><00:10:46.560><c> maths</c>

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
know we want to be creative with maths
 

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.590 align:start position:0%
know we want to be creative with maths
but<00:10:46.880><c> you</c><00:10:46.959><c> need</c><00:10:47.200><c> a</c>

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
but you need a
 

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.910 align:start position:0%
but you need a
bedrock<00:10:48.160><c> of</c><00:10:48.320><c> fundamental</c><00:10:48.959><c> skills</c><00:10:49.600><c> like</c><00:10:49.760><c> for</c>

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
bedrock of fundamental skills like for
 

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.710 align:start position:0%
bedrock of fundamental skills like for
example

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
example
 

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.310 align:start position:0%
example
once<00:10:50.959><c> you</c><00:10:51.040><c> know</c><00:10:51.200><c> that</c><00:10:51.440><c> 13</c><00:10:52.240><c> times</c><00:10:52.560><c> 75</c><00:10:53.200><c> is</c><00:10:53.360><c> 975</c>

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
once you know that 13 times 75 is 975
 

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.829 align:start position:0%
once you know that 13 times 75 is 975
then<00:10:54.560><c> you</c><00:10:54.640><c> can</c><00:10:54.800><c> be</c><00:10:54.959><c> creative</c><00:10:55.360><c> with</c><00:10:55.519><c> the</c><00:10:55.600><c> other</c>

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
then you can be creative with the other
 

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:57.110 align:start position:0%
then you can be creative with the other
numbers<00:10:56.160><c> there</c><00:10:56.399><c> yeah</c><00:10:56.640><c> but</c><00:10:56.800><c> if</c><00:10:56.880><c> you</c><00:10:56.959><c> haven't</c>

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
numbers there yeah but if you haven't
 

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
numbers there yeah but if you haven't
got<00:10:57.279><c> that</c><00:10:57.519><c> then</c><00:10:57.760><c> it's</c><00:10:57.839><c> going</c><00:10:57.920><c> to</c><00:10:58.000><c> be</c><00:10:58.160><c> difficult</c>

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
got that then it's going to be difficult
 

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.750 align:start position:0%
got that then it's going to be difficult
to<00:10:58.640><c> get</c><00:10:58.959><c> right</c><00:10:59.200><c> up</c><00:10:59.360><c> there</c>

00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
to get right up there
 

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.509 align:start position:0%
to get right up there
and<00:10:59.920><c> i</c><00:11:00.079><c> think</c><00:11:00.320><c> i</c><00:11:00.480><c> think</c><00:11:00.720><c> it's</c><00:11:00.880><c> so</c><00:11:01.120><c> easy</c><00:11:01.279><c> to</c><00:11:01.360><c> pick</c>

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
and i think i think it's so easy to pick
 

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.949 align:start position:0%
and i think i think it's so easy to pick
it<00:11:01.600><c> up</c><00:11:01.760><c> with</c><00:11:01.920><c> practice</c><00:11:02.480><c> like</c>

when you're first doing you have to
 

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
when you're first doing you have to

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
think through each step and then
 

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.990 align:start position:0%

gradually that thing becomes more

were maybe the close ones that i lost in
 

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.189 align:start position:0%
were maybe the close ones that i lost in

um where i lost it on the conundrum
there<00:16:07.920><c> was</c><00:16:08.000><c> a</c><00:16:08.160><c> number</c><00:16:08.399><c> that</c><00:16:08.480><c> i</c><00:16:08.560><c> needed</c><00:16:08.800><c> to</c><00:16:08.880><c> get</c>
