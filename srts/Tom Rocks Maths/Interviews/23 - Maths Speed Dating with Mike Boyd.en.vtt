river yeah i mean it was a it's a mile
 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.189 align:start position:0%
river yeah i mean it was a it's a mile
white

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
white
 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.350 align:start position:0%
white
so<00:05:41.759><c> yeah</c><00:05:42.160><c> yeah</c><00:05:42.720><c> so</c><00:05:42.880><c> when</c><00:05:43.039><c> you</c><00:05:43.120><c> say</c><00:05:43.280><c> river</c>

so yeah yeah so when you say river
 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.550 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah so when you say river
yeah<00:05:45.440><c> i</c><00:05:45.520><c> know</c><00:05:45.759><c> i</c><00:05:45.840><c> suppose</c><00:05:46.160><c> you</c><00:05:46.240><c> could</c><00:05:46.400><c> just</c>

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i know i suppose you could just
 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.870 align:start position:0%
yeah i know i suppose you could just
paddle<00:05:46.880><c> across</c><00:05:47.440><c> no</c><00:05:47.600><c> it's</c><00:05:48.000><c> like</c><00:05:48.080><c> an</c>

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
paddle across no it's like an
 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.990 align:start position:0%
paddle across no it's like an
estuary<00:05:50.240><c> and</c><00:05:50.400><c> it's</c><00:05:50.560><c> tidal</c><00:05:51.520><c> um</c>

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
estuary and it's tidal um
 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.870 align:start position:0%
estuary and it's tidal um
so<00:05:52.160><c> you</c><00:05:52.240><c> kind</c><00:05:52.479><c> of</c><00:05:52.560><c> have</c><00:05:52.639><c> to</c><00:05:52.800><c> swim</c><00:05:53.120><c> in</c><00:05:53.199><c> like</c><00:05:53.360><c> a</c><00:05:53.840><c> um</c>

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
so you kind of have to swim in like a um
 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.710 align:start position:0%
so you kind of have to swim in like a um
a<00:05:55.039><c> quadratic</c><00:05:55.680><c> shape</c>

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.909 align:start position:0%
 
no<00:05:58.880><c> you</c><00:05:58.960><c> have</c><00:05:59.039><c> to</c><00:05:59.199><c> you</c><00:05:59.280><c> have</c><00:05:59.360><c> to</c><00:05:59.440><c> swim</c><00:05:59.680><c> in</c><00:05:59.759><c> this</c>

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
no you have to you have to swim in this
 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.790 align:start position:0%
no you have to you have to swim in this
curve<00:06:00.479><c> uh</c><00:06:01.440><c> and</c><00:06:01.520><c> there's</c><00:06:01.759><c> like</c><00:06:02.000><c> jellyfish</c><00:06:02.720><c> and</c>

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
curve uh and there's like jellyfish and
 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.469 align:start position:0%
curve uh and there's like jellyfish and
there<00:06:02.960><c> was</c><00:06:03.120><c> dolphins</c><00:06:03.600><c> and</c><00:06:03.759><c> seals</c><00:06:04.160><c> in</c><00:06:04.240><c> there</c>

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
wetsuit on um and it would get easier
 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.110 align:start position:0%
wetsuit on um and it would get easier
yeah<00:06:42.400><c> yeah</c><00:06:42.720><c> like</c><00:06:42.960><c> uh</c><00:06:43.840><c> yeah</c><00:06:44.080><c> really</c><00:06:44.720><c> it</c><00:06:44.800><c> got</c><00:06:45.039><c> to</c>

the point where
 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.309 align:start position:0%
the point where
i<00:06:46.319><c> was</c><00:06:46.840><c> in</c><00:06:48.080><c> uh</c>

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
i was in uh
 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.070 align:start position:0%
i was in uh
water<00:06:50.639><c> that</c><00:06:50.720><c> was</c><00:06:50.960><c> nine</c><00:06:51.199><c> degrees</c><00:06:51.680><c> and</c><00:06:51.840><c> i</c><00:06:51.919><c> was</c>

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
water that was nine degrees and i was
 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.350 align:start position:0%
water that was nine degrees and i was
just<00:06:52.479><c> swimming</c><00:06:52.800><c> around</c>

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
just swimming around
 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.510 align:start position:0%
just swimming around
like<00:06:53.599><c> not</c><00:06:53.759><c> shivering</c><00:06:54.240><c> and</c><00:06:54.479><c> i</c><00:06:54.639><c> was</c><00:06:54.800><c> fine</c><00:06:55.280><c> what's</c>

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
like not shivering and i was fine what's
 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.830 align:start position:0%
like not shivering and i was fine what's
like<00:06:56.240><c> if</c><00:06:56.400><c> i</c><00:06:56.479><c> went</c><00:06:56.639><c> into</c><00:06:56.800><c> the</c><00:06:56.960><c> sea</c><00:06:57.199><c> today</c>

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
like if i went into the sea today
 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.390 align:start position:0%
like if i went into the sea today
like<00:06:58.160><c> so</c><00:06:58.319><c> if</c><00:06:58.479><c> if</c><00:06:58.639><c> the</c><00:06:58.800><c> sea</c><00:06:59.039><c> was</c><00:06:59.520><c> 15</c><00:07:00.000><c> degrees</c>

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
like so if if the sea was 15 degrees
 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.990 align:start position:0%
like so if if the sea was 15 degrees
like<00:07:00.720><c> it</c><00:07:00.800><c> would</c><00:07:00.960><c> be</c><00:07:01.199><c> like</c><00:07:01.360><c> a</c><00:07:01.520><c> shock</c><00:07:01.840><c> when</c><00:07:01.919><c> you</c>

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
like it would be like a shock when you
 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.550 align:start position:0%
like it would be like a shock when you
went<00:07:02.240><c> in</c>

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
went in
 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.710 align:start position:0%

we did have to do a base calculus course
 

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.110 align:start position:0%
we did have to do a base calculus course
but<00:21:39.679><c> i</c><00:21:39.840><c> might</c><00:21:40.000><c> be</c><00:21:40.159><c> wrong</c><00:21:40.400><c> about</c><00:21:40.640><c> that</c><00:21:40.880><c> i</c><00:21:41.039><c> have</c>

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
in um fluid dynamics like like massive
 

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.149 align:start position:0%
in um fluid dynamics like like massive
massive<00:21:57.679><c> uh</c><00:21:58.080><c> pages</c><00:21:59.039><c> uh</c><00:21:59.440><c> so</c><00:21:59.679><c> yeah</c>

00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
massive uh pages uh so yeah
 

00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:03.669 align:start position:0%
massive uh pages uh so yeah
that<00:22:00.640><c> did</c><00:22:00.799><c> a</c><00:22:00.880><c> better</c><00:22:01.120><c> math</c><00:22:02.880><c> awesome</c>

00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
that did a better math awesome
 

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:06.710 align:start position:0%
that did a better math awesome
and<00:22:03.919><c> clearly</c><00:22:04.640><c> still</c><00:22:04.960><c> still</c><00:22:05.280><c> not</c><00:22:05.760><c> too</c><00:22:05.919><c> rusty</c><00:22:06.640><c> i</c>

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
and clearly still still not too rusty i
 

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.350 align:start position:0%
and clearly still still not too rusty i
mean

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
mean
 

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.870 align:start position:0%
mean
we'll<00:22:07.520><c> see</c><00:22:07.760><c> again</c><00:22:08.080><c> we'll</c><00:22:08.240><c> see</c><00:22:08.400><c> how</c><00:22:08.480><c> you</c><00:22:08.559><c> get</c><00:22:08.720><c> on</c>

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
we'll see again we'll see how you get on
 

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
we'll see again we'll see how you get on
but<00:22:10.159><c> i</c><00:22:10.320><c> think</c><00:22:10.559><c> there's</c><00:22:10.799><c> there's</c><00:22:10.960><c> something</c>

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
but i think there's there's something
 

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.310 align:start position:0%
but i think there's there's something
there<00:22:11.600><c> there's</c><00:22:11.760><c> something</c><00:22:12.080><c> there's</c>

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
there there's something there's
 

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.110 align:start position:0%
there there's something there's
something<00:22:12.720><c> there</c>

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
something there
 

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.710 align:start position:0%
something there
okay<00:22:13.760><c> right</c><00:22:14.880><c> um</c><00:22:16.000><c> we're</c><00:22:16.159><c> just</c><00:22:16.240><c> gonna</c><00:22:16.400><c> do</c><00:22:16.559><c> more</c>

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay right um we're just gonna do more
 

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.390 align:start position:0%
okay right um we're just gonna do more
mass<00:22:16.960><c> ones</c><00:22:17.120><c> at</c><00:22:17.200><c> this</c><00:22:17.360><c> point</c><00:22:17.520><c> aren't</c><00:22:17.679><c> we</c>

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
mass ones at this point aren't we
 

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.549 align:start position:0%
mass ones at this point aren't we
i<00:22:18.559><c> think</c><00:22:18.880><c> i</c><00:22:18.960><c> think</c><00:22:19.120><c> so</c><00:22:19.360><c> i</c><00:22:19.440><c> mean</c><00:22:20.000><c> it's</c><00:22:20.159><c> a</c><00:22:20.240><c> title</c>

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
i think i think so i mean it's a title
 

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
i think i think so i mean it's a title
isn't<00:22:20.799><c> it</c><00:22:21.039><c> it's</c><00:22:21.200><c> math</c><00:22:21.440><c> speed</c><00:22:21.760><c> dating</c>

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
isn't it it's math speed dating
 

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.549 align:start position:0%
isn't it it's math speed dating
we've<00:22:22.480><c> just</c><00:22:22.640><c> had</c><00:22:22.799><c> speed</c><00:22:23.120><c> dating</c><00:22:23.440><c> so</c><00:22:23.679><c> far</c><00:22:23.919><c> so</c>

00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
we've just had speed dating so far so
 

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:26.310 align:start position:0%
we've just had speed dating so far so
all<00:22:24.720><c> right</c><00:22:25.039><c> this</c><00:22:25.200><c> is</c><00:22:25.280><c> a</c><00:22:25.360><c> math</c><00:22:25.600><c> one</c><00:22:25.760><c> then</c>

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
all right this is a math one then
 

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.909 align:start position:0%
all right this is a math one then
um<00:22:26.640><c> so</c><00:22:26.960><c> do</c><00:22:27.120><c> you</c><00:22:27.200><c> have</c><00:22:27.360><c> a</c><00:22:27.520><c> favorite</c><00:22:27.919><c> equation</c>

00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
um so do you have a favorite equation
 

00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:35.750 align:start position:0%
um so do you have a favorite equation
favorite<00:22:30.240><c> equation</c><00:22:31.039><c> yeah</c><00:22:31.600><c> um</c>

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:48.390 align:start position:0%
understand it and then i was one day
i<00:22:47.120><c> was</c><00:22:47.360><c> i</c><00:22:47.520><c> was</c><00:22:47.600><c> working</c><00:22:47.919><c> with</c><00:22:48.080><c> it</c><00:22:48.159><c> and</c><00:22:48.240><c> then</c><00:22:48.320><c> i</c>

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
i was i was working with it and then i
 

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.149 align:start position:0%
i was i was working with it and then i
was<00:22:48.559><c> like</c><00:22:48.720><c> oh</c><00:22:48.960><c> this</c><00:22:49.280><c> is</c>

00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
was like oh this is
 

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:51.990 align:start position:0%
was like oh this is
equivalent<00:22:50.640><c> to</c><00:22:50.799><c> this</c><00:22:51.120><c> and</c><00:22:51.360><c> yeah</c><00:22:51.600><c> and</c><00:22:51.679><c> when</c><00:22:51.840><c> i</c>

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
equivalent to this and yeah and when i
 

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.270 align:start position:0%
equivalent to this and yeah and when i
understood<00:22:52.480><c> what</c>

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
understood what
 

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.549 align:start position:0%
understood what
hydrostatic<00:22:54.080><c> head</c><00:22:54.720><c> actually</c><00:22:55.120><c> means</c>

00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
hydrostatic head actually means
 

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:57.990 align:start position:0%
hydrostatic head actually means
and<00:22:56.640><c> how</c><00:22:56.799><c> it</c><00:22:56.880><c> equates</c><00:22:57.280><c> to</c><00:22:57.440><c> pressure</c><00:22:57.840><c> and</c>

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
and how it equates to pressure and
 

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.669 align:start position:0%
and how it equates to pressure and
things<00:22:58.240><c> like</c><00:22:58.320><c> that</c><00:22:58.960><c> um</c>

00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
things like that um
 

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:03.190 align:start position:0%
things like that um
i<00:22:59.840><c> thought</c><00:23:00.000><c> that</c><00:23:00.080><c> was</c><00:23:00.240><c> a</c><00:23:00.640><c> neat</c><00:23:00.880><c> equation</c><00:23:01.840><c> um</c>

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
i thought that was a neat equation um
 

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.870 align:start position:0%
i thought that was a neat equation um
so<00:23:03.360><c> if</c><00:23:03.520><c> anyone</c><00:23:03.760><c> doesn't</c><00:23:04.000><c> know</c><00:23:04.400><c> bernoulli's</c>

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
so if anyone doesn't know bernoulli's
 

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.549 align:start position:0%
so if anyone doesn't know bernoulli's
equation<00:23:05.280><c> it</c><00:23:05.360><c> basically</c><00:23:05.760><c> says</c>

00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
equation it basically says
 

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.950 align:start position:0%
equation it basically says
pressure<00:23:06.960><c> plus</c><00:23:07.280><c> velocity</c><00:23:07.760><c> is</c><00:23:07.919><c> constant</c><00:23:08.720><c> in</c>

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
pressure plus velocity is constant in
 

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.669 align:start position:0%
pressure plus velocity is constant in
short

00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
short
 

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:11.350 align:start position:0%
short
when<00:23:09.919><c> you're</c><00:23:10.080><c> on</c><00:23:10.320><c> streamlines</c><00:23:10.880><c> around</c><00:23:11.200><c> an</c>

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
when you're on streamlines around an
 

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.909 align:start position:0%
when you're on streamlines around an
object<00:23:12.640><c> that</c><00:23:12.799><c> sounds</c><00:23:13.200><c> very</c><00:23:13.600><c> specific</c>

00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
object that sounds very specific
 

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:17.909 align:start position:0%
object that sounds very specific
basically<00:23:16.400><c> it</c><00:23:16.559><c> basically</c><00:23:17.039><c> says</c><00:23:17.360><c> yeah</c>

00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
basically it basically says yeah
 

00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:19.669 align:start position:0%
basically it basically says yeah
pressure<00:23:18.240><c> plus</c><00:23:18.400><c> velocity</c><00:23:18.880><c> is</c><00:23:18.960><c> constant</c><00:23:19.440><c> so</c>

00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
pressure plus velocity is constant so
 

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:20.950 align:start position:0%
pressure plus velocity is constant so
you<00:23:19.919><c> can</c><00:23:20.000><c> think</c><00:23:20.240><c> of</c><00:23:20.320><c> it</c><00:23:20.480><c> in</c>

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
you can think of it in
 

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.390 align:start position:0%
you can think of it in
it<00:23:21.120><c> kind</c><00:23:21.200><c> of</c><00:23:21.360><c> it</c><00:23:21.520><c> says</c><00:23:21.760><c> that</c><00:23:21.919><c> if</c><00:23:22.080><c> you</c><00:23:22.159><c> have</c><00:23:22.240><c> an</c>

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
it kind of it says that if you have an
 

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.230 align:start position:0%
it kind of it says that if you have an
area<00:23:22.640><c> of</c><00:23:22.799><c> low</c><00:23:23.120><c> pressure</c>

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
area of low pressure
 

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.950 align:start position:0%
area of low pressure
um<00:23:24.799><c> then</c><00:23:24.960><c> your</c><00:23:25.120><c> velocity</c><00:23:25.520><c> must</c><00:23:25.679><c> be</c><00:23:25.840><c> higher</c><00:23:26.880><c> in</c>

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
um then your velocity must be higher in
 

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.390 align:start position:0%
um then your velocity must be higher in
order<00:23:27.200><c> to</c><00:23:27.280><c> maintain</c><00:23:27.600><c> that</c><00:23:27.760><c> constant</c><00:23:28.080><c> value</c>

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
order to maintain that constant value
 

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.750 align:start position:0%
order to maintain that constant value
versus<00:23:28.720><c> an</c><00:23:28.799><c> area</c><00:23:29.039><c> of</c><00:23:29.120><c> high</c><00:23:29.280><c> pressure</c><00:23:29.600><c> when</c>

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
versus an area of high pressure when
 

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.470 align:start position:0%
versus an area of high pressure when
your<00:23:29.840><c> velocity</c>

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
your velocity
 

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.710 align:start position:0%
your velocity
would<00:23:30.640><c> be</c><00:23:30.799><c> lower</c><00:23:31.280><c> and</c><00:23:31.600><c> vice</c><00:23:31.840><c> versa</c><00:23:32.400><c> it's</c><00:23:32.559><c> all</c>

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
would be lower and vice versa it's all
 

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.710 align:start position:0%
would be lower and vice versa it's all
to<00:23:32.799><c> do</c><00:23:32.960><c> with</c><00:23:33.200><c> flight</c><00:23:33.600><c> and</c><00:23:33.760><c> drag</c><00:23:34.159><c> and</c>

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
to do with flight and drag and
 

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.870 align:start position:0%
to do with flight and drag and
aerodynamics<00:23:35.520><c> and</c><00:23:36.320><c> as</c><00:23:36.480><c> you</c><00:23:36.559><c> said</c><00:23:36.799><c> i'm</c>

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
aerodynamics and as you said i'm
 

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.909 align:start position:0%
aerodynamics and as you said i'm
guessing<00:23:37.120><c> this</c><00:23:37.200><c> came</c><00:23:37.440><c> up</c><00:23:37.520><c> in</c><00:23:37.600><c> your</c><00:23:37.679><c> fluid</c>

00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
guessing this came up in your fluid
 

00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:38.390 align:start position:0%
guessing this came up in your fluid
dynamics

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
dynamics
 

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.510 align:start position:0%
dynamics
yeah<00:23:38.640><c> yeah</c><00:23:39.200><c> and</c><00:23:39.679><c> yeah</c><00:23:40.400><c> it</c><00:23:40.559><c> did</c><00:23:41.039><c> um</c>

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and yeah it did um
 

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and yeah it did um
but<00:23:41.919><c> but</c><00:23:42.240><c> i</c><00:23:42.400><c> think</c><00:23:42.640><c> if</c><00:23:42.880><c> if</c><00:23:43.200><c> if</c><00:23:43.440><c> we</c><00:23:43.600><c> had</c><00:23:43.760><c> to</c><00:23:43.840><c> do</c>

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
but but i think if if if we had to do
 

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.350 align:start position:0%
but but i think if if if we had to do
like<00:23:44.159><c> a</c><00:23:44.240><c> more</c><00:23:44.559><c> simple</c><00:23:44.960><c> less</c>

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
like a more simple less
 

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.350 align:start position:0%
like a more simple less
specific<00:23:45.840><c> equation</c><00:23:46.400><c> it</c><00:23:46.559><c> would</c><00:23:46.640><c> just</c><00:23:46.880><c> be</c><00:23:47.120><c> f</c>

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
specific equation it would just be f
 

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
specific equation it would just be f
equals<00:23:47.679><c> m</c><00:23:47.840><c> a</c><00:23:48.320><c> like</c>

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
equals m a like
 

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
equals m a like
classic<00:23:49.600><c> yeah</c><00:23:50.720><c> because</c><00:23:50.960><c> it</c><00:23:51.440><c> always</c><00:23:51.679><c> comes</c><00:23:52.000><c> up</c>

00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
classic yeah because it always comes up
 

00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:55.029 align:start position:0%
classic yeah because it always comes up
like<00:23:52.400><c> it</c><00:23:52.559><c> always</c><00:23:52.799><c> pops</c><00:23:53.039><c> up</c><00:23:53.120><c> it</c><00:23:53.200><c> does</c>

00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
like it always pops up it does
 

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:58.390 align:start position:0%
like it always pops up it does
and<00:23:55.279><c> it's</c><00:23:55.520><c> and</c><00:23:55.760><c> it's</c><00:23:56.559><c> like</c><00:23:56.880><c> so</c><00:23:57.200><c> simple</c><00:23:57.919><c> um</c>

00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's like so simple um
 

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.029 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's like so simple um
yes<00:23:58.960><c> this</c><00:23:59.200><c> is</c><00:23:59.360><c> yes</c><00:23:59.840><c> it's</c><00:24:00.000><c> so</c><00:24:00.159><c> simple</c><00:24:00.480><c> to</c><00:24:00.640><c> say</c>

00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
yes this is yes it's so simple to say
 

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:02.470 align:start position:0%
yes this is yes it's so simple to say
and<00:24:01.200><c> yeah</c><00:24:01.360><c> encapsulates</c><00:24:02.159><c> like</c>

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
and yeah encapsulates like
 

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.390 align:start position:0%
and yeah encapsulates like
the<00:24:02.640><c> universe</c><00:24:02.960><c> yeah</c><00:24:03.360><c> yeah</c><00:24:03.360><c> yeah</c><00:24:04.080><c> do</c><00:24:04.159><c> you</c><00:24:04.240><c> say</c>

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
the universe yeah yeah yeah do you say
 

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.549 align:start position:0%
the universe yeah yeah yeah do you say
so<00:24:04.640><c> simple</c><00:24:04.960><c> the</c><00:24:05.039><c> equation</c><00:24:05.520><c> is</c><00:24:05.600><c> simple</c><00:24:06.000><c> the</c>

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
so simple the equation is simple the
 

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:09.190 align:start position:0%
so simple the equation is simple the
ideas<00:24:07.039><c> it</c><00:24:07.120><c> represents</c><00:24:07.840><c> but</c><00:24:08.159><c> like</c><00:24:08.799><c> you</c><00:24:08.960><c> can</c>

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
ideas it represents but like you can
 

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.909 align:start position:0%
ideas it represents but like you can
really

00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
really
 

00:24:09.919 --> 00:24:11.269 align:start position:0%

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
multiple so i think it's euler
 

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.310 align:start position:0%
multiple so i think it's euler
nice<00:24:43.600><c> that</c><00:24:43.760><c> would</c><00:24:43.919><c> be</c><00:24:44.000><c> my</c><00:24:44.840><c> answer</c><00:24:45.919><c> because</c>

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
nice that would be my answer because
 

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.909 align:start position:0%
nice that would be my answer because
every<00:24:46.720><c> time</c><00:24:46.960><c> i</c><00:24:47.039><c> look</c><00:24:47.200><c> at</c><00:24:47.360><c> something</c>

00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
every time i look at something
 

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:49.669 align:start position:0%
every time i look at something

00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
interesting it's it's him it's
 

00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:50.950 align:start position:0%
interesting it's it's him it's
loyalistic<00:24:50.400><c> yeah</c>

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
loyalistic yeah
yeah<00:24:51.440><c> yeah</c><00:24:51.760><c> um</c><00:24:52.480><c> so</c><00:24:52.799><c> true</c><00:24:53.120><c> so</c><00:24:53.360><c> true</c><00:24:53.600><c> he</c><00:24:53.679><c> figured</c>

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah um so true so true he figured
 

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah um so true so true he figured
out<00:24:54.159><c> everything</c>

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
out everything
 

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.190 align:start position:0%
out everything
uh<00:24:55.200><c> and</c><00:24:55.360><c> not</c><00:24:55.600><c> really</c><00:24:55.919><c> random</c><00:24:56.400><c> stuff</c><00:24:57.200><c> um</c>

00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh and not really random stuff um
 

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.710 align:start position:0%
uh and not really random stuff um
so<00:24:59.440><c> yeah</c><00:24:59.760><c> uh</c><00:25:00.240><c> i</c><00:25:00.640><c> i</c><00:25:00.799><c> think</c><00:25:01.679><c> euler</c>

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
so yeah uh i i think euler
 

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.789 align:start position:0%
so yeah uh i i think euler
was<00:25:02.960><c> the</c><00:25:03.120><c> one</c><00:25:03.360><c> who</c><00:25:04.400><c> um</c>

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:09.909 align:start position:0%
 
he<00:25:07.279><c> he</c><00:25:07.440><c> basically</c><00:25:08.000><c> figured</c><00:25:08.320><c> out</c><00:25:08.640><c> e</c><00:25:09.039><c> right</c><00:25:09.520><c> yeah</c>

00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
he he basically figured out e right yeah
 

00:25:09.919 --> 00:25:11.909 align:start position:0%
he he basically figured out e right yeah
yeah<00:25:10.080><c> euler's</c><00:25:10.400><c> number</c><00:25:10.720><c> yeah</c><00:25:10.960><c> named</c><00:25:11.200><c> after</c><00:25:11.440><c> him</c>

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
yeah euler's number yeah named after him
 

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:14.630 align:start position:0%
yeah euler's number yeah named after him
yep<00:25:12.799><c> various</c><00:25:13.200><c> mathematicians</c><00:25:13.919><c> worked</c><00:25:14.240><c> on</c><00:25:14.400><c> it</c>

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
yep various mathematicians worked on it
 

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.190 align:start position:0%
yep various mathematicians worked on it
and<00:25:14.799><c> its</c><00:25:14.960><c> concepts</c><00:25:15.440><c> but</c><00:25:15.600><c> it</c><00:25:15.760><c> is</c><00:25:16.400><c> yeah</c><00:25:16.960><c> named</c>

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
and its concepts but it is yeah named
 

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:17.909 align:start position:0%

00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
and the way the way he did that the way
 

00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:21.110 align:start position:0%
and the way the way he did that the way
the<00:25:20.080><c> proof</c><00:25:20.320><c> for</c><00:25:20.480><c> that</c><00:25:20.720><c> is</c>

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
the proof for that is
 

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.350 align:start position:0%
the proof for that is
is<00:25:21.279><c> so</c><00:25:22.000><c> nice</c><00:25:22.320><c> to</c><00:25:22.400><c> watch</c><00:25:22.640><c> when</c><00:25:22.799><c> someone</c><00:25:23.120><c> writes</c>

i<00:25:43.039><c> think</c><00:25:43.279><c> it</c><00:25:43.679><c> it's</c><00:25:43.840><c> on</c><00:25:44.000><c> like</c><00:25:44.159><c> a</c><00:25:44.240><c> parabolic</c>

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
i think it it's on like a parabolic
 

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.070 align:start position:0%
i think it it's on like a parabolic
shape

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
shape
 

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.710 align:start position:0%
shape
and<00:25:46.159><c> you</c><00:25:46.320><c> spin</c><00:25:46.559><c> the</c><00:25:46.720><c> disc</c><00:25:47.039><c> and</c><00:25:47.279><c> as</c><00:25:47.760><c> as</c><00:25:48.080><c> uh</c><00:25:48.400><c> it</c>

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
and you spin the disc and as as uh it
 

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.350 align:start position:0%
and you spin the disc and as as uh it
spins

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
spins
 

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.870 align:start position:0%
spins
the<00:25:50.320><c> the</c><00:25:50.640><c> edge</c><00:25:51.440><c> creates</c><00:25:51.760><c> a</c><00:25:51.919><c> sum</c><00:25:52.320><c> that</c><00:25:52.480><c> like</c>

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
the the edge creates a sum that like
 

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.789 align:start position:0%
the the edge creates a sum that like
ramps<00:25:53.200><c> up</c><00:25:53.360><c> in</c><00:25:53.520><c> frequency</c><00:25:54.240><c> so</c><00:25:54.400><c> it</c><00:25:54.840><c> goes</c>

00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
ramps up in frequency so it goes
 

00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:58.470 align:start position:0%
ramps up in frequency so it goes
you<00:25:56.880><c> know</c><00:25:56.960><c> when</c><00:25:57.120><c> you</c><00:25:57.279><c> drop</c><00:25:57.520><c> a</c><00:25:57.919><c> coin</c><00:25:58.240><c> and</c><00:25:58.400><c> it</c>

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know when you drop a coin and it
 

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.070 align:start position:0%
you know when you drop a coin and it
like<00:25:58.720><c> spins</c><00:25:59.200><c> and</c><00:25:59.279><c> then</c><00:25:59.520><c> the</c><00:25:59.600><c> noise</c><00:25:59.919><c> goes</c>

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
like spins and then the noise goes
 

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.350 align:start position:0%
like spins and then the noise goes
higher<00:26:00.320><c> and</c><00:26:00.400><c> higher</c><00:26:00.640><c> and</c><00:26:00.720><c> higher</c><00:26:00.960><c> yeah</c>

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
higher and higher and higher yeah
 

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.190 align:start position:0%
higher and higher and higher yeah
um<00:26:01.919><c> i'm</c><00:26:02.000><c> not</c><00:26:02.159><c> sure</c><00:26:02.400><c> why</c><00:26:02.559><c> it's</c><00:26:02.640><c> called</c><00:26:02.880><c> euler's</c>

disc<00:26:03.440><c> i</c><00:26:03.520><c> think</c><00:26:03.679><c> it's</c><00:26:03.840><c> because</c><00:26:04.080><c> he</c><00:26:04.240><c> was</c><00:26:04.320><c> the</c><00:26:04.559><c> one</c>

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
disc i think it's because he was the one
 

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.310 align:start position:0%
disc i think it's because he was the one
who<00:26:04.880><c> first</c><00:26:05.120><c> described</c><00:26:05.600><c> why</c><00:26:05.919><c> that</c>

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
you've survived
 

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.149 align:start position:0%
you've survived
so<00:26:25.840><c> and</c><00:26:25.919><c> didn't</c><00:26:26.159><c> rule</c><00:26:26.400><c> a</c><00:26:26.480><c> one</c><00:26:26.799><c> once</c><00:26:27.200><c> no</c><00:26:27.840><c> single</c>

00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
so and didn't rule a one once no single
 

00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:29.750 align:start position:0%
so and didn't rule a one once no single
one<00:26:28.400><c> you</c><00:26:28.480><c> know</c><00:26:28.720><c> once</c><00:26:28.960><c> again</c><00:26:29.200><c> we</c><00:26:29.279><c> just</c><00:26:29.440><c> had</c><00:26:29.600><c> to</c>

00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
i really need to change it so that maths
 

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:34.390 align:start position:0%
i really need to change it so that maths
is<00:26:33.200><c> on</c><00:26:33.440><c> more</c><00:26:33.600><c> than</c><00:26:33.760><c> just</c><00:26:34.000><c> one</c>
