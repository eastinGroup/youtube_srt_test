i remember when you first showed me this
 

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.510 align:start position:0%

program i i definitely showed this to a
 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.870 align:start position:0%
program i i definitely showed this to a
lot<00:00:03.679><c> of</c><00:00:03.679><c> my</c><00:00:03.840><c> friends</c><00:00:04.080><c> and</c><00:00:04.240><c> i</c><00:00:04.319><c> was</c><00:00:04.400><c> like</c><00:00:04.640><c> it's</c>

lot of my friends and i was like it's
 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.749 align:start position:0%
lot of my friends and i was like it's
mesmerizing

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 align:start position:0%
mesmerizing
 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.829 align:start position:0%
mesmerizing
i<00:00:05.839><c> could</c><00:00:06.000><c> just</c><00:00:06.160><c> sit</c><00:00:06.319><c> and</c><00:00:06.480><c> watch</c><00:00:06.720><c> this</c><00:00:07.279><c> honestly</c>

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
i could just sit and watch this honestly
 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:09.430 align:start position:0%
i could just sit and watch this honestly
for<00:00:08.000><c> hours</c><00:00:08.480><c> it's</c><00:00:08.720><c> just</c>

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
for hours it's just
 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.709 align:start position:0%
for hours it's just
it<00:00:09.599><c> is</c><00:00:09.760><c> beautiful</c><00:00:10.480><c> so</c><00:00:10.719><c> this</c><00:00:11.040><c> one</c><00:00:12.000><c> is</c><00:00:12.240><c> also</c>

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
it is beautiful so this one is also
 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.350 align:start position:0%
it is beautiful so this one is also
single<00:00:13.120><c> bricks</c><00:00:13.920><c> but</c><00:00:14.160><c> this</c><00:00:14.480><c> time</c><00:00:14.880><c> the</c><00:00:15.040><c> single</c>

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
single bricks but this time the single
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.670 align:start position:0%
single bricks but this time the single
bricks<00:00:15.599><c> can</c><00:00:15.839><c> also</c><00:00:16.000><c> stick</c><00:00:16.320><c> to</c><00:00:16.480><c> the</c><00:00:16.640><c> neighbors</c>

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
bricks can also stick to the neighbors
 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.310 align:start position:0%
bricks can also stick to the neighbors
if<00:00:17.840><c> we</c><00:00:18.000><c> just</c><00:00:18.320><c> look</c><00:00:18.560><c> at</c><00:00:18.720><c> what</c><00:00:18.960><c> happens</c><00:00:20.080><c> you</c><00:00:20.160><c> see</c>

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
if we just look at what happens you see
 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.750 align:start position:0%
if we just look at what happens you see
they<00:00:20.560><c> fall</c><00:00:20.800><c> down</c>

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
they fall down
 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.670 align:start position:0%
they fall down
but<00:00:21.840><c> they</c><00:00:22.080><c> actually</c><00:00:22.480><c> stick</c><00:00:22.880><c> they</c><00:00:23.039><c> stick</c><00:00:23.359><c> to</c><00:00:23.519><c> it</c>

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
but they actually stick they stick to it
 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.950 align:start position:0%
but they actually stick they stick to it
right<00:00:23.920><c> it's</c><00:00:24.000><c> like</c><00:00:24.080><c> they're</c><00:00:24.160><c> magnetic</c>

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
right it's like they're magnetic
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.390 align:start position:0%
right it's like they're magnetic
exactly<00:00:26.080><c> to</c><00:00:26.320><c> either</c><00:00:26.560><c> side</c><00:00:27.039><c> yeah</c><00:00:27.359><c> yeah</c>

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
exactly to either side yeah yeah
 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.230 align:start position:0%
exactly to either side yeah yeah
then<00:00:28.960><c> you</c><00:00:29.119><c> zoom</c><00:00:29.359><c> out</c><00:00:29.519><c> again</c><00:00:29.840><c> it</c><00:00:29.920><c> looks</c>

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
then you zoom out again it looks
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.870 align:start position:0%
then you zoom out again it looks
basically<00:00:30.640><c> the</c><00:00:30.800><c> same</c><00:00:31.039><c> as</c><00:00:31.199><c> tetris</c>

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
basically the same as tetris
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.590 align:start position:0%
basically the same as tetris
right<00:00:33.200><c> so</c><00:00:33.520><c> one</c><00:00:34.239><c> so</c><00:00:34.399><c> as</c><00:00:34.559><c> fun</c><00:00:34.800><c> as</c><00:00:34.960><c> it</c><00:00:35.040><c> is</c><00:00:35.200><c> to</c><00:00:35.360><c> use</c>

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
right so one so as fun as it is to use
 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.110 align:start position:0%
right so one so as fun as it is to use
the<00:00:35.760><c> tetris</c><00:00:36.160><c> bricks</c><00:00:36.480><c> there's</c><00:00:36.640><c> nothing</c><00:00:36.960><c> but</c>

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
the tetris bricks there's nothing but
 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.549 align:start position:0%
the tetris bricks there's nothing but
there's<00:00:37.440><c> nothing</c><00:00:37.760><c> in</c><00:00:37.920><c> this</c><00:00:38.079><c> particular</c>

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this particular
 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.069 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this particular
there's<00:00:38.719><c> nothing</c><00:00:39.040><c> special</c><00:00:39.520><c> at</c><00:00:39.680><c> all</c>

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
there's nothing special at all
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.030 align:start position:0%
there's nothing special at all
um<00:00:40.559><c> i</c><00:00:40.719><c> see</c><00:00:41.200><c> there's</c><00:00:41.440><c> obviously</c><00:00:42.239><c> no</c><00:00:42.480><c> scientific</c>

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
um i see there's obviously no scientific
 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.350 align:start position:0%
um i see there's obviously no scientific
literature<00:00:43.520><c> from</c><00:00:43.680><c> the</c><00:00:43.840><c> tetris</c><00:00:44.320><c> model</c>

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.029 align:start position:0%
 
there's<00:00:47.600><c> a</c><00:00:47.680><c> lot</c><00:00:47.920><c> of</c><00:00:48.079><c> physical</c><00:00:48.480><c> literature</c><00:00:48.960><c> on</c>

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of physical literature on
 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.389 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of physical literature on
this<00:00:49.280><c> one</c><00:00:49.440><c> which</c><00:00:49.680><c> is</c><00:00:49.760><c> called</c><00:00:50.000><c> ballistic</c>

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
this one which is called ballistic
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.510 align:start position:0%
this one which is called ballistic
deposition<00:00:51.039><c> so</c><00:00:51.199><c> that's</c>

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
deposition so that's
 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.709 align:start position:0%
deposition so that's
that's<00:00:51.760><c> the</c><00:00:51.920><c> one</c><00:00:52.079><c> where</c><00:00:52.239><c> you</c><00:00:52.399><c> just</c><00:00:52.559><c> have</c>

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
that's the one where you just have
 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.150 align:start position:0%
that's the one where you just have
single<00:00:53.039><c> bricks</c><00:00:53.440><c> but</c><00:00:53.520><c> they</c><00:00:53.760><c> stick</c><00:00:54.000><c> to</c>

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
single bricks but they stick to
 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.790 align:start position:0%
single bricks but they stick to
neighbors

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.150 align:start position:0%
neighbors
right<00:00:54.960><c> because</c><00:00:55.199><c> that's</c><00:00:55.440><c> somehow</c><00:00:55.760><c> one</c><00:00:55.920><c> of</c><00:00:56.000><c> the</c>

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
right because that's somehow one of the
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.389 align:start position:0%
right because that's somehow one of the
simplest<00:00:56.559><c> ones</c><00:00:56.800><c> you</c><00:00:56.879><c> can</c><00:00:57.440><c> say</c><00:00:57.840><c> it's</c><00:00:58.000><c> easier</c><00:00:58.320><c> to</c>

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
simplest ones you can say it's easier to
 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.029 align:start position:0%
simplest ones you can say it's easier to
formulate

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
formulate
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.349 align:start position:0%
formulate
the<00:00:59.120><c> ballistic</c><00:00:59.600><c> deposition</c><00:01:00.480><c> model</c><00:01:00.879><c> you</c><00:01:01.039><c> have</c>

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
the ballistic deposition model you have
 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.869 align:start position:0%
the ballistic deposition model you have
the<00:01:01.680><c> the</c><00:01:01.920><c> bricks</c><00:01:02.160><c> coming</c><00:01:02.480><c> down</c>

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 align:start position:0%
the the bricks coming down
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.270 align:start position:0%
the the bricks coming down
and<00:01:02.960><c> then</c><00:01:03.120><c> you</c><00:01:03.280><c> have</c><00:01:04.159><c> those</c><00:01:04.400><c> three</c><00:01:04.640><c> choices</c>

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
and then you have those three choices
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.429 align:start position:0%
and then you have those three choices
and<00:01:05.600><c> it's</c><00:01:05.840><c> picking</c><00:01:06.080><c> the</c><00:01:06.240><c> maximum</c>

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
and it's picking the maximum
 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.870 align:start position:0%
and it's picking the maximum
because<00:01:07.600><c> it's</c><00:01:07.760><c> going</c><00:01:07.920><c> to</c><00:01:08.080><c> be</c><00:01:08.240><c> the</c><00:01:08.400><c> tallest</c><00:01:08.720><c> one</c>

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be the tallest one
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.070 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be the tallest one
so<00:01:08.960><c> it's</c><00:01:09.119><c> either</c><00:01:09.280><c> adding</c><00:01:09.520><c> to</c><00:01:09.600><c> the</c><00:01:09.680><c> top</c><00:01:09.840><c> of</c><00:01:10.000><c> the</c>

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
so it's either adding to the top of the
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.550 align:start position:0%
so it's either adding to the top of the
stack

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 align:start position:0%

range of three pixels that's called them
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.789 align:start position:0%
range of three pixels that's called them
whereas<00:01:19.920><c> here</c><00:01:20.560><c> you're</c><00:01:20.799><c> saying</c><00:01:21.840><c> same</c><00:01:22.159><c> idea</c><00:01:22.640><c> but</c>

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
whereas here you're saying same idea but
 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.390 align:start position:0%
whereas here you're saying same idea but
it's<00:01:22.960><c> picking</c><00:01:23.439><c> one</c><00:01:23.680><c> of</c><00:01:23.759><c> those</c>

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's picking one of those
 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.070 align:start position:0%
it's picking one of those
to<00:01:24.560><c> interact</c><00:01:24.960><c> with</c><00:01:25.119><c> completely</c><00:01:25.520><c> at</c><00:01:25.600><c> random</c>

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
to interact with completely at random
 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.990 align:start position:0%
to interact with completely at random
yeah<00:01:27.040><c> okay</c>

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.749 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
right<00:01:28.400><c> and</c><00:01:28.479><c> then</c><00:01:28.720><c> this</c><00:01:28.960><c> gives</c><00:01:29.280><c> completely</c>

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 align:start position:0%
right and then this gives completely
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.749 align:start position:0%
right and then this gives completely
different<00:01:30.000><c> behavior</c><00:01:30.799><c> yeah</c>

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 align:start position:0%
different behavior yeah
 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.030 align:start position:0%
different behavior yeah
okay<00:01:32.159><c> so</c><00:01:32.479><c> what</c><00:01:33.439><c> so</c><00:01:33.600><c> what</c><00:01:33.759><c> do</c><00:01:33.920><c> we</c><00:01:34.079><c> see</c>

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay so what so what do we see
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.109 align:start position:0%
okay so what so what do we see
when<00:01:35.200><c> we</c><00:01:35.360><c> do</c><00:01:35.520><c> that</c><00:01:35.759><c> the</c><00:01:35.920><c> ballistic</c><00:01:36.560><c> deposition</c>

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
when we do that the ballistic deposition
 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.630 align:start position:0%
when we do that the ballistic deposition
model<00:01:37.360><c> with</c><00:01:37.600><c> it</c><00:01:37.680><c> picking</c><00:01:38.000><c> randomly</c>

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
model with it picking randomly
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.789 align:start position:0%
model with it picking randomly
right<00:01:39.040><c> then</c><00:01:39.200><c> you</c><00:01:39.360><c> see</c><00:01:39.600><c> something</c><00:01:39.920><c> like</c><00:01:40.240><c> that</c>

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.389 align:start position:0%
 
let's<00:01:43.040><c> see</c><00:01:44.320><c> so</c><00:01:44.560><c> at</c><00:01:44.640><c> this</c><00:01:44.880><c> stage</c>

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
let's see so at this stage
 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.109 align:start position:0%
let's see so at this stage
it<00:01:46.560><c> looks</c><00:01:47.520><c> somewhat</c><00:01:48.079><c> similar</c><00:01:48.560><c> to</c><00:01:48.799><c> what</c><00:01:49.040><c> we</c>

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
it looks somewhat similar to what we
 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:49.510 align:start position:0%
it looks somewhat similar to what we
said

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
said
 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.789 align:start position:0%
said
i<00:01:49.600><c> was</c><00:01:49.680><c> about</c><00:01:49.920><c> to</c><00:01:50.000><c> say</c><00:01:50.320><c> you</c><00:01:50.399><c> have</c><00:01:50.640><c> the</c>

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
i was about to say you have the
 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.630 align:start position:0%
i was about to say you have the
impression<00:01:51.200><c> that</c><00:01:51.439><c> it</c><00:01:51.520><c> might</c><00:01:51.759><c> have</c><00:01:51.920><c> a</c><00:01:52.000><c> feeling</c>

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
impression that it might have a feeling
 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.149 align:start position:0%
impression that it might have a feeling
there<00:01:52.880><c> could</c><00:01:53.119><c> be</c><00:01:53.280><c> a</c><00:01:53.360><c> difference</c><00:01:54.799><c> yeah</c><00:01:55.119><c> but</c><00:01:55.280><c> you</c>

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
there could be a difference yeah but you
 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.389 align:start position:0%
there could be a difference yeah but you
you<00:01:56.320><c> do</c><00:01:56.560><c> start</c><00:01:56.960><c> to</c><00:01:57.119><c> see</c><00:01:57.439><c> that</c><00:01:57.840><c> you</c><00:01:57.920><c> know</c><00:01:58.159><c> some</c>

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
you do start to see that you know some
 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.310 align:start position:0%
you do start to see that you know some
bitter<00:01:58.799><c> stuff</c><00:01:59.119><c> moving</c><00:01:59.520><c> much</c><00:01:59.840><c> faster</c><00:02:00.159><c> you</c>

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
bitter stuff moving much faster you
 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.109 align:start position:0%
bitter stuff moving much faster you
actually<00:02:00.560><c> don't</c><00:02:00.719><c> really</c>

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
actually don't really
 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.469 align:start position:0%
actually don't really
so<00:02:01.280><c> here</c><00:02:01.520><c> it</c><00:02:01.600><c> looks</c><00:02:01.759><c> like</c><00:02:02.000><c> it's</c><00:02:02.159><c> actually</c>

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
so here it looks like it's actually
 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.550 align:start position:0%
so here it looks like it's actually
pretty<00:02:02.799><c> high</c><00:02:03.040><c> on</c><00:02:03.520><c> yes</c><00:02:04.000><c> uh</c>

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
pretty high on yes uh
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.109 align:start position:0%
pretty high on yes uh
so<00:02:04.719><c> if</c><00:02:04.880><c> we</c><00:02:05.600><c> if</c><00:02:05.759><c> we</c><00:02:05.840><c> kind</c><00:02:06.000><c> of</c><00:02:06.159><c> zoom</c><00:02:06.399><c> out</c><00:02:06.640><c> we</c><00:02:06.880><c> see</c>

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
so if we if we kind of zoom out we see
 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.670 align:start position:0%
so if we if we kind of zoom out we see
that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
that
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.550 align:start position:0%
that
now<00:02:07.840><c> there's</c><00:02:08.160><c> actually</c><00:02:08.640><c> really</c><00:02:09.039><c> tall</c><00:02:09.440><c> peaks</c>

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
now there's actually really tall peaks
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.350 align:start position:0%
now there's actually really tall peaks
yes

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.869 align:start position:0%
yes
right<00:02:11.599><c> okay</c><00:02:11.920><c> that's</c><00:02:12.239><c> all</c><00:02:12.480><c> now</c><00:02:12.640><c> it</c><00:02:12.720><c> looks</c>

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 align:start position:0%
right okay that's all now it looks
 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.869 align:start position:0%
right okay that's all now it looks
different<00:02:13.280><c> now</c><00:02:13.440><c> you're</c><00:02:13.520><c> right</c><00:02:14.000><c> now</c>

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
different now you're right now
 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.309 align:start position:0%
different now you're right now
it's<00:02:15.120><c> very</c><00:02:15.360><c> different</c><00:02:15.680><c> so</c><00:02:15.920><c> you</c><00:02:16.000><c> have</c><00:02:16.160><c> these</c>

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's very different so you have these
 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.589 align:start position:0%
it's very different so you have these
very<00:02:16.640><c> tall</c><00:02:17.599><c> towers</c><00:02:18.000><c> yes</c><00:02:18.319><c> yes</c>

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
very tall towers yes yes
 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.470 align:start position:0%
very tall towers yes yes
and<00:02:19.680><c> so</c><00:02:19.840><c> you</c><00:02:19.920><c> have</c><00:02:20.160><c> these</c><00:02:20.959><c> big</c><00:02:21.280><c> jumps</c><00:02:22.160><c> and</c><00:02:22.319><c> they</c>

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
and so you have these big jumps and they
 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.710 align:start position:0%
and so you have these big jumps and they
don't<00:02:22.720><c> get</c><00:02:22.879><c> any</c><00:02:23.120><c> smaller</c>

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't get any smaller
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.750 align:start position:0%
don't get any smaller
and<00:02:25.120><c> also</c><00:02:25.360><c> very</c><00:02:25.599><c> big</c><00:02:26.239><c> values</c><00:02:26.720><c> or</c><00:02:27.200><c> like</c>

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
and also very big values or like
 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.390 align:start position:0%
and also very big values or like
as<00:02:27.920><c> well</c><00:02:28.319><c> yeah</c><00:02:29.599><c> so</c><00:02:29.760><c> this</c><00:02:29.920><c> is</c><00:02:30.080><c> a</c><00:02:30.160><c> completely</c>

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
as well yeah so this is a completely
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.070 align:start position:0%
as well yeah so this is a completely
different<00:02:30.720><c> behavior</c><00:02:31.200><c> this</c><00:02:31.360><c> is</c><00:02:31.519><c> a</c><00:02:31.599><c> completely</c>

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
different behavior this is a completely
 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.190 align:start position:0%
different behavior this is a completely
different<00:02:32.319><c> behavior</c><00:02:32.800><c> so</c><00:02:32.959><c> that's</c><00:02:33.120><c> a</c>

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
different behavior so that's a
 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.550 align:start position:0%
different behavior so that's a
completely<00:02:33.680><c> different</c>

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
completely different
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.710 align:start position:0%
completely different
universality<00:02:35.440><c> class</c><00:02:35.760><c> so</c><00:02:35.920><c> to</c><00:02:36.080><c> speak</c><00:02:37.360><c> okay</c>

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
universality class so to speak okay
 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.869 align:start position:0%
universality class so to speak okay
can<00:02:39.040><c> you</c><00:02:39.120><c> get</c><00:02:39.360><c> more</c><00:02:39.760><c> universality</c><00:02:40.560><c> classes</c>

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 align:start position:0%
can you get more universality classes
 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.350 align:start position:0%
can you get more universality classes
through<00:02:41.280><c> similar</c><00:02:41.680><c> kinds</c><00:02:42.000><c> of</c><00:02:42.080><c> models</c><00:02:42.480><c> or</c>

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
through similar kinds of models or
 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.509 align:start position:0%
through similar kinds of models or
do<00:02:43.519><c> we</c><00:02:43.680><c> know</c><00:02:43.840><c> about</c><00:02:44.080><c> that</c><00:02:44.319><c> is</c><00:02:44.720><c> yes</c><00:02:44.959><c> still</c><00:02:45.280><c> to</c><00:02:45.360><c> be</c>

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 align:start position:0%
do we know about that is yes still to be
 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.270 align:start position:0%
do we know about that is yes still to be
discovered<00:02:46.000><c> but</c><00:02:46.160><c> still</c><00:02:46.319><c> to</c><00:02:46.480><c> be</c><00:02:46.640><c> discovered</c><00:02:47.120><c> to</c>

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
discovered but still to be discovered to
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.869 align:start position:0%
discovered but still to be discovered to
some<00:02:47.519><c> extent</c><00:02:47.920><c> right</c><00:02:48.160><c> so</c><00:02:48.319><c> there's</c><00:02:48.560><c> some</c><00:02:48.800><c> of</c>

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
some extent right so there's some of
 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.309 align:start position:0%
some extent right so there's some of
them<00:02:49.120><c> we</c><00:02:49.280><c> know</c><00:02:49.519><c> so</c><00:02:49.680><c> we</c><00:02:49.840><c> know</c>

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
them we know so we know
 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.949 align:start position:0%
them we know so we know
the<00:02:50.480><c> one</c><00:02:50.720><c> that</c><00:02:51.040><c> the</c><00:02:51.280><c> tetris</c><00:02:51.680><c> game</c><00:02:52.000><c> lives</c><00:02:52.319><c> in</c><00:02:52.640><c> uh</c>

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
the one that the tetris game lives in uh
 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.350 align:start position:0%
the one that the tetris game lives in uh
is<00:02:53.120><c> called</c><00:02:53.440><c> the</c><00:02:53.519><c> kpz</c><00:02:54.000><c> universality</c><00:02:54.800><c> class</c>

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
is called the kpz universality class
 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.149 align:start position:0%
is called the kpz universality class
okay<00:02:55.599><c> so</c><00:02:55.840><c> then</c><00:02:56.160><c> there</c><00:02:56.319><c> is</c><00:02:56.480><c> the</c><00:02:56.640><c> one</c><00:02:57.599><c> of</c><00:02:57.840><c> the</c>

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay so then there is the one of the
 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.229 align:start position:0%
okay so then there is the one of the
symmetric<00:02:58.720><c> interface</c><00:02:59.200><c> fluctuations</c><00:03:00.000><c> which</c>

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
symmetric interface fluctuations which
 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.830 align:start position:0%

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
is called the edwardsville
 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.550 align:start position:0%
is called the edwardsville

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
universality class which some sense if
 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.949 align:start position:0%
universality class which some sense if
you

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 align:start position:0%
you
 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.270 align:start position:0%
you
take<00:03:05.200><c> a</c><00:03:05.360><c> snapshot</c><00:03:06.080><c> at</c><00:03:06.319><c> fixed</c><00:03:06.640><c> time</c><00:03:07.120><c> you</c>

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
take a snapshot at fixed time you
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.869 align:start position:0%
take a snapshot at fixed time you
wouldn't<00:03:07.680><c> tell</c><00:03:07.920><c> the</c><00:03:08.080><c> difference</c><00:03:08.560><c> from</c><00:03:08.720><c> the</c>

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 align:start position:0%
wouldn't tell the difference from the
 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.710 align:start position:0%
wouldn't tell the difference from the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
kpz and the edwards working so
 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.309 align:start position:0%
kpz and the edwards working so
if<00:03:10.800><c> you</c><00:03:10.879><c> look</c><00:03:11.040><c> at</c><00:03:11.200><c> a</c><00:03:11.280><c> movie</c><00:03:11.599><c> you</c><00:03:11.760><c> actually</c><00:03:12.159><c> see</c>

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
if you look at a movie you actually see
 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.309 align:start position:0%
if you look at a movie you actually see
the<00:03:12.480><c> difference</c><00:03:12.879><c> they</c><00:03:13.280><c> behave</c><00:03:13.599><c> differently</c>

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
the difference they behave differently
 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.229 align:start position:0%
the difference they behave differently
yeah<00:03:15.680><c> and</c><00:03:15.760><c> then</c><00:03:15.920><c> there's</c><00:03:16.800><c> this</c><00:03:17.040><c> one</c><00:03:17.280><c> which</c><00:03:17.519><c> is</c>

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
yeah and then there's this one which is
 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.149 align:start position:0%
yeah and then there's this one which is
different<00:03:18.720><c> as</c><00:03:18.800><c> well</c><00:03:19.519><c> does</c><00:03:19.680><c> this</c><00:03:19.840><c> one</c><00:03:20.000><c> have</c><00:03:20.080><c> a</c>

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.630 align:start position:0%
different as well does this one have a

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
name yet no well we call that
 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.470 align:start position:0%

that<00:03:22.879><c> process</c><00:03:23.360><c> we</c><00:03:23.519><c> call</c><00:03:23.680><c> it</c><00:03:23.760><c> the</c><00:03:23.920><c> brownian</c>

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
that process we call it the brownian
 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.830 align:start position:0%
that process we call it the brownian

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
castle because
 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.270 align:start position:0%
castle because
well<00:03:26.080><c> i</c><00:03:26.159><c> like</c><00:03:26.560><c> these</c><00:03:30.840><c> yeah</c>

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
well i like these yeah
 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.710 align:start position:0%
well i like these yeah
there<00:03:33.519><c> do</c><00:03:33.760><c> seem</c><00:03:34.000><c> to</c><00:03:34.159><c> be</c><00:03:35.360><c> others</c><00:03:36.159><c> but</c><00:03:36.400><c> it's</c><00:03:36.640><c> not</c>

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
there do seem to be others but it's not
 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.550 align:start position:0%
there do seem to be others but it's not
there<00:03:38.879><c> aren't</c><00:03:39.120><c> that</c><00:03:39.360><c> many</c><00:03:39.680><c> of</c><00:03:39.840><c> them</c><00:03:40.159><c> right</c><00:03:40.319><c> so</c>

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
there aren't that many of them right so
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.070 align:start position:0%
there aren't that many of them right so
it's<00:03:40.720><c> not</c><00:03:40.879><c> easy</c><00:03:41.120><c> to</c><00:03:41.280><c> come</c><00:03:41.519><c> up</c><00:03:41.680><c> with</c><00:03:41.840><c> a</c><00:03:41.920><c> new</c>

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's not easy to come up with a new
 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.830 align:start position:0%
it's not easy to come up with a new
model<00:03:42.400><c> that</c><00:03:42.560><c> actually</c><00:03:42.879><c> behaves</c><00:03:43.280><c> differently</c>

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
model that actually behaves differently
 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.470 align:start position:0%
model that actually behaves differently
from

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
from
 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.309 align:start position:0%
from
from<00:03:44.799><c> yeah</c><00:03:45.040><c> so</c><00:03:45.280><c> if</c><00:03:45.360><c> you</c><00:03:45.440><c> just</c><00:03:45.680><c> play</c><00:03:45.920><c> around</c>

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
from yeah so if you just play around
 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.670 align:start position:0%
from yeah so if you just play around
more<00:03:46.480><c> than</c><00:03:46.720><c> randomly</c><00:03:47.120><c> it's</c><00:03:47.200><c> something</c><00:03:47.519><c> that</c>

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
more than randomly it's something that
 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
more than randomly it's something that
is

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
is
 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
is
roughly<00:03:48.319><c> these</c><00:03:48.560><c> type</c><00:03:48.799><c> of</c><00:03:48.879><c> features</c><00:03:50.319><c> um</c>

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 align:start position:0%
roughly these type of features um
 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.910 align:start position:0%
roughly these type of features um

there<00:03:52.080><c> are</c><00:03:52.239><c> very</c><00:03:52.400><c> good</c><00:03:52.640><c> chances</c><00:03:53.040><c> that</c><00:03:53.200><c> it's</c>

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
there are very good chances that it's
 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.429 align:start position:0%
there are very good chances that it's

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
going to be in one of these three
 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.429 align:start position:0%
going to be in one of these three
classes<00:03:56.000><c> and</c><00:03:56.159><c> this</c><00:03:56.400><c> one</c><00:03:56.560><c> is</c><00:03:56.720><c> a</c><00:03:57.040><c> naturally</c>

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 align:start position:0%

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.990 align:start position:0%

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
occurring phenomena this is
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
occurring phenomena this is
this<00:04:00.159><c> one</c><00:04:00.480><c> is</c><00:04:00.720><c> not</c><00:04:01.040><c> so</c><00:04:01.360><c> natural</c><00:04:01.840><c> because</c><00:04:02.239><c> of</c>

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
this one is not so natural because of
 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.229 align:start position:0%
this one is not so natural because of
this<00:04:02.640><c> lack</c><00:04:02.879><c> of</c><00:04:03.040><c> cohesiveness</c>

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
this lack of cohesiveness
 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.990 align:start position:0%
this lack of cohesiveness
right<00:04:04.480><c> so</c><00:04:04.640><c> here</c><00:04:04.879><c> you</c><00:04:05.120><c> you</c><00:04:05.280><c> have</c><00:04:05.439><c> these</c><00:04:05.760><c> very</c>

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%

it's not something that tends to form if
 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.030 align:start position:0%
it's not something that tends to form if
you<00:04:15.760><c> think</c><00:04:16.000><c> of</c><00:04:16.079><c> this</c><00:04:16.239><c> as</c><00:04:16.400><c> something</c><00:04:16.720><c> like</c><00:04:16.880><c> a</c>

that<00:04:18.479><c> would</c><00:04:18.639><c> not</c><00:04:18.799><c> be</c><00:04:18.959><c> a</c><00:04:19.040><c> very</c><00:04:19.199><c> natural</c>

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
that would not be a very natural
 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.509 align:start position:0%
that would not be a very natural
behavior<00:04:20.079><c> well</c><00:04:20.239><c> yeah</c><00:04:20.400><c> these</c><00:04:20.720><c> these</c><00:04:21.280><c> i</c><00:04:21.359><c> think</c>

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
behavior well yeah these these i think
 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.629 align:start position:0%
behavior well yeah these these i think
you<00:04:21.600><c> mentioned</c><00:04:21.840><c> before</c><00:04:22.079><c> these</c><00:04:22.240><c> kind</c><00:04:22.479><c> they're</c>

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
you mentioned before these kind they're
 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.070 align:start position:0%
you mentioned before these kind they're
like<00:04:22.800><c> almost</c><00:04:23.040><c> like</c><00:04:23.120><c> discontinuities</c><00:04:24.000><c> aren't</c>

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
like almost like discontinuities aren't
 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.390 align:start position:0%
like almost like discontinuities aren't
they

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
they
 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.189 align:start position:0%
they
they<00:04:24.560><c> are</c><00:04:25.360><c> they</c><00:04:25.520><c> are</c><00:04:25.680><c> really</c><00:04:25.919><c> discontinuation</c>

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
they are they are really discontinuation
 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.350 align:start position:0%
they are they are really discontinuation
so<00:04:27.360><c> there</c><00:04:27.520><c> is</c><00:04:27.600><c> a</c><00:04:27.759><c> limiting</c><00:04:28.160><c> process</c><00:04:28.720><c> that</c><00:04:29.040><c> has</c>

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
so there is a limiting process that has
 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.950 align:start position:0%
so there is a limiting process that has
discontinued

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
discontinued
 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.189 align:start position:0%
discontinued
dense<00:04:31.360><c> sets</c><00:04:31.680><c> of</c><00:04:31.840><c> discontinuities</c><00:04:32.880><c> it's</c><00:04:33.040><c> like</c>

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
dense sets of discontinuities it's like
 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.390 align:start position:0%
dense sets of discontinuities it's like
breaking<00:04:33.840><c> yeah</c>

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
breaking yeah
 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.830 align:start position:0%
breaking yeah
it's<00:04:34.479><c> like</c><00:04:34.639><c> snapping</c><00:04:35.040><c> so</c><00:04:35.199><c> that's</c><00:04:35.360><c> why</c><00:04:35.600><c> it's</c>

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's like snapping so that's why it's
 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.830 align:start position:0%
it's like snapping so that's why it's
fine<00:04:36.160><c> yeah</c><00:04:36.320><c> well</c><00:04:36.479><c> you</c><00:04:36.560><c> wouldn't</c><00:04:36.800><c> expect</c><00:04:37.199><c> it</c><00:04:37.280><c> to</c>

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
fine yeah well you wouldn't expect it to
 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.030 align:start position:0%
fine yeah well you wouldn't expect it to
actually<00:04:38.240><c> but</c><00:04:38.479><c> it</c><00:04:38.639><c> does</c><00:04:39.040><c> well</c><00:04:39.360><c> at</c><00:04:39.520><c> least</c><00:04:40.800><c> one</c>

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
actually but it does well at least one
 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.990 align:start position:0%
actually but it does well at least one
can<00:04:41.199><c> somehow</c>

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
can somehow
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.710 align:start position:0%
can somehow
tell<00:04:42.240><c> oneself</c><00:04:42.800><c> a</c><00:04:42.880><c> story</c><00:04:43.280><c> so</c><00:04:43.440><c> if</c><00:04:43.520><c> you</c><00:04:43.600><c> take</c><00:04:44.240><c> some</c>

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
tell oneself a story so if you take some
 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
tell oneself a story so if you take some
there<00:04:44.880><c> are</c><00:04:44.960><c> some</c>

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
there are some
 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
there are some
population<00:04:46.639><c> genetics</c><00:04:47.199><c> models</c><00:04:47.759><c> that</c><00:04:48.720><c> where</c>

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
population genetics models that where
 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.469 align:start position:0%
population genetics models that where
you<00:04:49.040><c> could</c><00:04:49.280><c> tell</c><00:04:49.520><c> yourself</c><00:04:49.919><c> a</c><00:04:50.000><c> story</c><00:04:50.320><c> that</c>

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
you could tell yourself a story that
 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:51.830 align:start position:0%
you could tell yourself a story that
something<00:04:50.800><c> along</c><00:04:51.120><c> these</c><00:04:51.280><c> lines</c><00:04:51.600><c> could</c>

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
something along these lines could
 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.189 align:start position:0%
something along these lines could
actually<00:04:52.160><c> occur</c><00:04:52.479><c> and</c><00:04:52.639><c> then</c>

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
actually occur and then
 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.510 align:start position:0%
actually occur and then
so<00:04:53.600><c> in</c><00:04:53.759><c> situations</c><00:04:54.240><c> where</c><00:04:54.479><c> the</c><00:04:55.199><c> where</c><00:04:55.360><c> for</c>

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
so in situations where the where for
 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.390 align:start position:0%
so in situations where the where for

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
some reason the
 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.350 align:start position:0%
some reason the

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
population is actually spread out uh in
 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.110 align:start position:0%
population is actually spread out uh in

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
beach for example or something like that
 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.270 align:start position:0%
beach for example or something like that
okay<00:05:06.720><c> but</c><00:05:07.759><c> but</c>

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay but but
 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.950 align:start position:0%
okay but but
so<00:05:09.520><c> how</c><00:05:09.759><c> much</c><00:05:10.000><c> away</c><00:05:10.240><c> i</c><00:05:10.479><c> am</c><00:05:11.199><c> yeah</c><00:05:11.680><c> for</c><00:05:11.919><c> currents</c>

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
so how much away i am yeah for currents
 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
so how much away i am yeah for currents
that's<00:05:13.199><c> fascinating</c><00:05:14.080><c> is</c><00:05:14.320><c> is</c><00:05:14.479><c> this</c><00:05:15.120><c> currently</c>

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay what one really wants to understand
 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.029 align:start position:0%
okay what one really wants to understand
is<00:06:29.120><c> four</c><00:06:29.360><c> dimensions</c><00:06:30.000><c> because</c><00:06:30.400><c> time</c><00:06:30.720><c> counts</c>

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
is four dimensions because time counts
 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.350 align:start position:0%
is four dimensions because time counts
as<00:06:31.120><c> a</c><00:06:31.199><c> dimension</c><00:06:31.680><c> yeah</c>

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
as a dimension yeah
 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.309 align:start position:0%
as a dimension yeah
and<00:06:34.000><c> so</c><00:06:34.479><c> we</c><00:06:34.720><c> are</c><00:06:34.880><c> currently</c><00:06:35.360><c> working</c><00:06:35.680><c> on</c><00:06:35.840><c> well</c>

they just break down precisely in four

they just break down precisely in four
