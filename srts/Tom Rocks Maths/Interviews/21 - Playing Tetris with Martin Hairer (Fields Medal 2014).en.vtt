did you play tetris growing up i do
 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.750 align:start position:0%
did you play tetris growing up i do
actually<00:00:02.480><c> yeah</c><00:00:02.720><c> okay</c><00:00:03.040><c> that's</c><00:00:03.280><c> awesome</c>

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually yeah okay that's awesome
 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.670 align:start position:0%
actually yeah okay that's awesome
do<00:00:03.840><c> you</c><00:00:03.919><c> think</c><00:00:04.000><c> that's</c><00:00:04.160><c> what</c><00:00:04.319><c> inspired</c><00:00:04.880><c> you</c><00:00:05.040><c> to</c>

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
do you think that's what inspired you to
 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.030 align:start position:0%
do you think that's what inspired you to
no

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
no
 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.589 align:start position:0%
no
i'm<00:00:07.200><c> not</c><00:00:07.440><c> sure</c><00:00:07.759><c> about</c><00:00:08.080><c> that</c><00:00:08.960><c> can</c><00:00:09.120><c> you</c><00:00:09.280><c> tell</c><00:00:09.440><c> us</c>

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about that can you tell us
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.150 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about that can you tell us
what<00:00:09.760><c> does</c>

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
what does
 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.629 align:start position:0%
what does
tetris<00:00:10.559><c> have</c><00:00:10.719><c> to</c><00:00:10.880><c> do</c><00:00:11.040><c> with</c><00:00:11.200><c> your</c><00:00:11.440><c> work</c><00:00:12.240><c> well</c>

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
tetris have to do with your work well
 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.950 align:start position:0%
tetris have to do with your work well
okay<00:00:12.880><c> so</c><00:00:13.040><c> that</c><00:00:13.280><c> part</c><00:00:13.519><c> of</c><00:00:13.679><c> my</c><00:00:13.920><c> work</c>

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay so that part of my work
 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.390 align:start position:0%
okay so that part of my work
concerns<00:00:15.839><c> interface</c><00:00:16.400><c> growth</c><00:00:17.920><c> and</c>

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
concerns interface growth and
 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.470 align:start position:0%
concerns interface growth and
so<00:00:18.720><c> the</c><00:00:19.119><c> sort</c><00:00:19.359><c> of</c><00:00:19.520><c> thing</c><00:00:19.760><c> that</c><00:00:20.000><c> you</c><00:00:20.080><c> can</c><00:00:20.240><c> have</c>

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
so the sort of thing that you can have
 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.429 align:start position:0%
so the sort of thing that you can have
in<00:00:20.640><c> mind</c>

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
in mind
 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.230 align:start position:0%
in mind
is<00:00:22.640><c> like</c><00:00:22.960><c> for</c><00:00:23.119><c> example</c><00:00:23.439><c> if</c><00:00:23.519><c> there's</c><00:00:23.760><c> a</c><00:00:23.840><c> forest</c>

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
is like for example if there's a forest
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.349 align:start position:0%
is like for example if there's a forest
fire

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
fire
 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.310 align:start position:0%
fire
so<00:00:25.519><c> the</c><00:00:25.680><c> fire</c><00:00:26.000><c> is</c><00:00:26.240><c> burning</c><00:00:27.439><c> behind</c><00:00:27.920><c> it</c><00:00:28.080><c> it</c>

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
so the fire is burning behind it it
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.230 align:start position:0%
so the fire is burning behind it it
leaves<00:00:28.560><c> a</c><00:00:28.720><c> region</c><00:00:29.039><c> that</c><00:00:29.199><c> was</c><00:00:29.439><c> burned</c><00:00:29.840><c> in</c><00:00:30.000><c> front</c>

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
leaves a region that was burned in front
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.950 align:start position:0%
leaves a region that was burned in front
of<00:00:30.400><c> it</c><00:00:30.560><c> as</c><00:00:30.720><c> a</c><00:00:30.800><c> region</c><00:00:31.039><c> which</c><00:00:31.279><c> is</c><00:00:31.439><c> unburned</c>

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
of it as a region which is unburned
 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
of it as a region which is unburned
and<00:00:33.040><c> so</c><00:00:33.200><c> you</c><00:00:33.280><c> have</c><00:00:33.440><c> an</c><00:00:33.600><c> interface</c><00:00:34.079><c> which</c><00:00:34.320><c> is</c>

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
and so you have an interface which is
 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.470 align:start position:0%
and so you have an interface which is
the<00:00:34.559><c> flame</c><00:00:34.960><c> front</c><00:00:35.440><c> that</c><00:00:35.680><c> separates</c><00:00:36.079><c> the</c><00:00:36.239><c> two</c>

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
the flame front that separates the two
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.350 align:start position:0%
the flame front that separates the two
regions

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
regions
 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.750 align:start position:0%
regions
and<00:00:37.520><c> it</c><00:00:37.680><c> moves</c><00:00:38.160><c> clearly</c><00:00:38.640><c> from</c><00:00:39.280><c> somehow</c><00:00:39.600><c> the</c>

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
and it moves clearly from somehow the
 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.830 align:start position:0%
and it moves clearly from somehow the
burnt<00:00:40.079><c> region</c><00:00:40.480><c> into</c><00:00:40.719><c> the</c><00:00:40.879><c> unburnt</c><00:00:41.360><c> region</c>

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
burnt region into the unburnt region
 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.470 align:start position:0%
burnt region into the unburnt region
and<00:00:44.399><c> now</c><00:00:44.879><c> one</c><00:00:45.120><c> thing</c><00:00:45.280><c> we're</c><00:00:45.520><c> interested</c><00:00:46.000><c> in</c>

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
and now one thing we're interested in
 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.389 align:start position:0%
and now one thing we're interested in
is<00:00:46.800><c> in</c><00:00:46.879><c> that</c><00:00:47.200><c> type</c><00:00:47.440><c> of</c><00:00:47.600><c> situations</c><00:00:48.239><c> to</c>

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
is in that type of situations to
 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.630 align:start position:0%
is in that type of situations to
describe<00:00:48.960><c> the</c><00:00:49.120><c> fluctuations</c><00:00:49.840><c> of</c><00:00:50.000><c> that</c><00:00:50.239><c> front</c>

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
describe the fluctuations of that front
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.389 align:start position:0%
describe the fluctuations of that front
right<00:00:50.800><c> so</c><00:00:51.039><c> the</c><00:00:51.120><c> front</c><00:00:51.440><c> moves</c><00:00:51.760><c> at</c><00:00:51.920><c> some</c><00:00:52.079><c> kind</c><00:00:52.239><c> of</c>

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
right so the front moves at some kind of
 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.069 align:start position:0%
right so the front moves at some kind of
average<00:00:52.800><c> speed</c>

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
average speed
 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.670 align:start position:0%
average speed
but<00:00:54.239><c> then</c><00:00:54.480><c> the</c><00:00:54.640><c> speed</c><00:00:54.960><c> is</c><00:00:55.039><c> not</c><00:00:55.199><c> completely</c>

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
but then the speed is not completely
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.110 align:start position:0%
but then the speed is not completely
uniform<00:00:56.160><c> so</c><00:00:56.320><c> there</c><00:00:56.399><c> are</c><00:00:56.480><c> bits</c><00:00:56.719><c> that</c><00:00:56.879><c> move</c><00:00:57.039><c> a</c>

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
uniform so there are bits that move a
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.470 align:start position:0%
uniform so there are bits that move a
little<00:00:57.280><c> bit</c><00:00:57.440><c> faster</c><00:00:57.840><c> this</c><00:00:58.079><c> will</c><00:00:58.160><c> move</c><00:00:58.399><c> a</c>

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
little bit faster this will move a
 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
little bit faster this will move a
little<00:00:58.640><c> bit</c><00:00:58.800><c> slower</c>

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
little bit slower
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.430 align:start position:0%
little bit slower
so<00:00:59.760><c> after</c><00:01:00.000><c> a</c><00:01:00.079><c> while</c><00:01:00.320><c> it's</c><00:01:00.559><c> going</c><00:01:00.719><c> to</c><00:01:01.039><c> even</c><00:01:01.280><c> if</c>

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
so after a while it's going to even if
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.950 align:start position:0%
so after a while it's going to even if
it<00:01:01.600><c> starts</c><00:01:01.840><c> out</c><00:01:02.079><c> flat</c>

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
it starts out flat
 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.789 align:start position:0%
it starts out flat
uh<00:01:03.280><c> after</c><00:01:03.520><c> a</c><00:01:03.600><c> bit</c><00:01:03.840><c> it's</c><00:01:04.000><c> going</c><00:01:04.159><c> to</c><00:01:04.320><c> look</c><00:01:04.559><c> a</c><00:01:04.640><c> bit</c>

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh after a bit it's going to look a bit
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
uh after a bit it's going to look a bit
rugged<00:01:05.199><c> like</c><00:01:05.439><c> that</c><00:01:05.680><c> right</c>

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
rugged like that right
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.590 align:start position:0%
rugged like that right
and<00:01:06.080><c> so</c><00:01:06.240><c> what</c><00:01:06.560><c> we're</c><00:01:06.799><c> interested</c><00:01:07.200><c> in</c><00:01:07.360><c> is</c><00:01:07.439><c> not</c>

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
and so what we're interested in is not
 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.270 align:start position:0%
and so what we're interested in is not
so<00:01:07.760><c> much</c><00:01:07.920><c> the</c><00:01:08.080><c> average</c><00:01:08.479><c> position</c>

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
so much the average position
 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.870 align:start position:0%
so much the average position
but<00:01:09.520><c> more</c><00:01:09.760><c> like</c><00:01:10.159><c> you</c><00:01:10.240><c> know</c><00:01:10.400><c> the</c><00:01:10.560><c> random</c>

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
but more like you know the random
 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.870 align:start position:0%
but more like you know the random
fluctuations<00:01:11.600><c> on</c><00:01:11.760><c> top</c>

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
fluctuations on top
 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.910 align:start position:0%
fluctuations on top
and<00:01:13.040><c> so</c><00:01:13.200><c> this</c><00:01:13.439><c> is</c><00:01:13.760><c> really</c><00:01:14.080><c> not</c><00:01:15.280><c> specifically</c>

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
and so this is really not specifically
 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.749 align:start position:0%
and so this is really not specifically
about<00:01:16.240><c> forest</c><00:01:16.640><c> fires</c><00:01:16.960><c> right</c><00:01:17.200><c> so</c><00:01:17.360><c> it's</c><00:01:17.520><c> really</c>

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 align:start position:0%
about forest fires right so it's really
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.550 align:start position:0%
about forest fires right so it's really
about

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
about
 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.749 align:start position:0%
about
any<00:01:18.880><c> situation</c><00:01:20.720><c> which</c><00:01:20.960><c> is</c>

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 align:start position:0%
any situation which is
 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.590 align:start position:0%
any situation which is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
um which is a liquid crystal
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.710 align:start position:0%
um which is a liquid crystal
so<00:02:10.319><c> that</c><00:02:10.560><c> one</c><00:02:10.800><c> you</c><00:02:11.039><c> take</c><00:02:11.760><c> a</c><00:02:11.840><c> liquid</c><00:02:12.160><c> crystal</c><00:02:12.560><c> so</c>

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that one you take a liquid crystal so
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.229 align:start position:0%
so that one you take a liquid crystal so
the<00:02:12.800><c> same</c><00:02:13.040><c> kind</c><00:02:13.200><c> of</c><00:02:13.280><c> liquid</c><00:02:13.680><c> crystals</c><00:02:14.160><c> you</c>

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
the same kind of liquid crystals you
 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.030 align:start position:0%
the same kind of liquid crystals you
have<00:02:14.400><c> in</c><00:02:14.480><c> your</c>

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 align:start position:0%

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
mobile phone or laptop screen and
 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.550 align:start position:0%
mobile phone or laptop screen and
that<00:02:19.120><c> one</c><00:02:19.599><c> it</c><00:02:19.760><c> also</c><00:02:20.000><c> it</c><00:02:20.080><c> comes</c><00:02:20.319><c> in</c><00:02:20.480><c> two</c><00:02:20.840><c> phases</c>

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
that one it also it comes in two phases
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.309 align:start position:0%
that one it also it comes in two phases
and<00:02:22.879><c> they</c><00:02:23.040><c> have</c><00:02:23.360><c> different</c><00:02:23.840><c> optical</c>

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
and they have different optical
 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.070 align:start position:0%
and they have different optical
properties<00:02:24.720><c> so</c><00:02:24.879><c> you</c><00:02:24.959><c> can</c><00:02:25.120><c> literally</c><00:02:25.680><c> see</c><00:02:25.920><c> the</c>

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
properties so you can literally see the
 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.910 align:start position:0%
properties so you can literally see the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
difference between the two
 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.190 align:start position:0%
difference between the two
and<00:02:28.000><c> so</c><00:02:28.160><c> all</c><00:02:28.319><c> you</c><00:02:28.480><c> have</c><00:02:28.560><c> to</c><00:02:28.640><c> do</c><00:02:28.800><c> is</c><00:02:28.959><c> take</c>

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
and so all you have to do is take
 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.509 align:start position:0%
and so all you have to do is take
pictures<00:02:29.599><c> of</c><00:02:29.760><c> it</c><00:02:29.920><c> basically</c><00:02:30.400><c> to</c><00:02:30.640><c> see</c>

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 align:start position:0%
pictures of it basically to see
 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.790 align:start position:0%
pictures of it basically to see
which<00:02:31.840><c> part</c><00:02:32.160><c> is</c><00:02:32.319><c> in</c><00:02:32.400><c> which</c><00:02:32.640><c> phase</c><00:02:34.400><c> and</c><00:02:34.560><c> one</c><00:02:34.720><c> of</c>

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
which part is in which phase and one of
 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
which part is in which phase and one of
them<00:02:34.959><c> is</c><00:02:35.120><c> again</c><00:02:35.440><c> more</c><00:02:35.599><c> stable</c>

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
them is again more stable
 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.589 align:start position:0%
them is again more stable
than<00:02:36.160><c> the</c><00:02:36.319><c> other</c><00:02:36.480><c> one</c><00:02:36.800><c> and</c><00:02:36.879><c> so</c><00:02:37.040><c> what</c><00:02:37.200><c> you</c><00:02:37.360><c> do</c><00:02:37.519><c> is</c>

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
than the other one and so what you do is
 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.190 align:start position:0%
than the other one and so what you do is
you<00:02:37.760><c> prepare</c><00:02:38.160><c> it</c><00:02:38.319><c> in</c><00:02:38.400><c> the</c><00:02:38.640><c> unstable</c><00:02:39.360><c> one</c>

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
you prepare it in the unstable one
 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.869 align:start position:0%
you prepare it in the unstable one
and<00:02:41.360><c> then</c><00:02:41.519><c> you</c><00:02:41.680><c> take</c><00:02:41.920><c> the</c><00:02:42.000><c> laser</c><00:02:42.319><c> beam</c><00:02:42.640><c> and</c><00:02:42.720><c> you</c>

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 align:start position:0%
and then you take the laser beam and you
 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.869 align:start position:0%
and then you take the laser beam and you
zap<00:02:43.200><c> it</c><00:02:43.360><c> at</c><00:02:43.519><c> it</c>

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
zap it at it
 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.110 align:start position:0%
zap it at it
and<00:02:45.040><c> where</c><00:02:45.280><c> the</c><00:02:45.519><c> where</c><00:02:45.680><c> the</c><00:02:45.840><c> laser</c><00:02:46.160><c> beam</c><00:02:46.480><c> hits</c>

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 align:start position:0%

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
the liquid crystal
 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.710 align:start position:0%
the liquid crystal
it<00:02:48.959><c> gives</c><00:02:49.280><c> enough</c><00:02:49.599><c> activation</c><00:02:50.160><c> energy</c><00:02:50.480><c> to</c>

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
it gives enough activation energy to
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.990 align:start position:0%
it gives enough activation energy to
flip

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 align:start position:0%

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
from the unstable into the stable state
 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.190 align:start position:0%
from the unstable into the stable state
right

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
right
 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.229 align:start position:0%
right
and<00:02:55.360><c> so</c><00:02:55.519><c> you</c><00:02:55.680><c> basically</c><00:02:56.239><c> draw</c><00:02:56.560><c> a</c><00:02:56.720><c> line</c><00:02:57.680><c> of</c>

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
and so you basically draw a line of
 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.550 align:start position:0%
and so you basically draw a line of
the<00:02:58.400><c> stable</c><00:02:58.879><c> region</c><00:02:59.519><c> which</c><00:02:59.760><c> you</c><00:02:59.840><c> can</c><00:03:00.319><c> it's</c>

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
the stable region which you can it's
 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.550 align:start position:0%
the stable region which you can it's
literally<00:03:01.040><c> drawing</c><00:03:01.440><c> you</c><00:03:01.599><c> actually</c><00:03:02.000><c> see</c>

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
literally drawing you actually see
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.630 align:start position:0%
literally drawing you actually see
the<00:03:02.720><c> difference</c><00:03:03.200><c> in</c><00:03:03.280><c> column</c><00:03:04.159><c> and</c><00:03:04.239><c> then</c><00:03:04.480><c> that</c>

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
the difference in column and then that
 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.149 align:start position:0%
the difference in column and then that
one<00:03:04.879><c> automatically</c>

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
one automatically
 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.070 align:start position:0%
one automatically
broadens<00:03:06.720><c> up</c><00:03:06.959><c> because</c><00:03:07.200><c> it's</c><00:03:07.360><c> more</c><00:03:07.519><c> stable</c><00:03:07.920><c> so</c>

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
broadens up because it's more stable so
 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.190 align:start position:0%
broadens up because it's more stable so
it<00:03:08.159><c> wants</c><00:03:08.319><c> to</c><00:03:08.480><c> invade</c>

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
it wants to invade
 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.430 align:start position:0%
it wants to invade
the<00:03:09.440><c> unstable</c><00:03:10.000><c> region</c><00:03:10.720><c> and</c><00:03:10.879><c> again</c><00:03:11.120><c> so</c><00:03:11.280><c> you</c>

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
the unstable region and again so you
 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.030 align:start position:0%
the unstable region and again so you
have<00:03:11.680><c> you</c><00:03:11.840><c> see</c><00:03:12.000><c> a</c><00:03:12.080><c> line</c><00:03:12.319><c> that</c><00:03:12.480><c> gets</c><00:03:12.720><c> thicker</c>

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
have you see a line that gets thicker
 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.630 align:start position:0%
have you see a line that gets thicker
and<00:03:13.200><c> thicker</c>

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
and thicker
 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.869 align:start position:0%
and thicker
and<00:03:14.800><c> it</c><00:03:14.959><c> starts</c><00:03:15.360><c> off</c><00:03:15.840><c> really</c><00:03:16.159><c> like</c><00:03:16.400><c> a</c><00:03:16.480><c> straight</c>

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 align:start position:0%
and it starts off really like a straight
 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.470 align:start position:0%
and it starts off really like a straight
line<00:03:17.440><c> it</c><00:03:17.519><c> gets</c><00:03:17.840><c> thicker</c>

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
line it gets thicker
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.309 align:start position:0%
line it gets thicker
but<00:03:18.640><c> then</c><00:03:18.800><c> the</c><00:03:18.959><c> boundaries</c><00:03:19.519><c> of</c><00:03:19.599><c> that</c><00:03:19.840><c> line</c>

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
but then the boundaries of that line
 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.830 align:start position:0%
but then the boundaries of that line
start<00:03:20.800><c> wobbling</c><00:03:21.200><c> a</c><00:03:21.360><c> little</c><00:03:21.519><c> bit</c>

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
start wobbling a little bit
 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.589 align:start position:0%
start wobbling a little bit
right<00:03:22.080><c> and</c><00:03:22.159><c> so</c><00:03:22.319><c> you're</c><00:03:22.480><c> interested</c><00:03:22.959><c> in</c><00:03:23.040><c> the</c>

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
right and so you're interested in the
 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.670 align:start position:0%
right and so you're interested in the
fluctuations<00:03:24.319><c> of</c><00:03:24.480><c> that</c><00:03:24.640><c> boundary</c>

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
fluctuations of that boundary
 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.869 align:start position:0%
fluctuations of that boundary
so<00:03:25.840><c> it</c><00:03:25.920><c> really</c><00:03:26.239><c> doesn't</c><00:03:26.640><c> matter</c><00:03:28.319><c> at</c><00:03:28.480><c> all</c><00:03:28.720><c> in</c>

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 align:start position:0%
so it really doesn't matter at all in
 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:29.750 align:start position:0%
so it really doesn't matter at all in
terms<00:03:29.120><c> of</c><00:03:29.200><c> the</c>

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the
 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.710 align:start position:0%
terms of the
sort<00:03:29.920><c> of</c><00:03:30.159><c> overriding</c><00:03:31.680><c> mathematics</c><00:03:32.319><c> physics</c>

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
sort of overriding mathematics physics
 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.270 align:start position:0%
sort of overriding mathematics physics
behind<00:03:32.959><c> right</c>

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
behind right
 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.350 align:start position:0%
behind right
it<00:03:33.360><c> really</c><00:03:33.599><c> doesn't</c><00:03:33.920><c> matter</c><00:03:34.959><c> it</c><00:03:35.040><c> would</c><00:03:35.200><c> be</c>

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't matter it would be
 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.229 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't matter it would be
essentially<00:03:36.000><c> the</c><00:03:36.159><c> same</c><00:03:36.400><c> mathematics</c>

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
essentially the same mathematics
 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.110 align:start position:0%
essentially the same mathematics
um<00:03:39.040><c> so</c><00:03:39.200><c> there's</c><00:03:39.440><c> this</c><00:03:39.680><c> idea</c><00:03:40.080><c> of</c><00:03:40.239><c> universality</c>

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
um so there's this idea of universality
 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.149 align:start position:0%
um so there's this idea of universality
which<00:03:41.360><c> is</c><00:03:41.519><c> that</c>

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
which is that
 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.830 align:start position:0%
which is that
for<00:03:42.400><c> some</c><00:03:42.720><c> things</c><00:03:43.120><c> so</c><00:03:43.280><c> for</c><00:03:43.440><c> example</c><00:03:43.760><c> the</c>

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
for some things so for example the
 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.509 align:start position:0%
for some things so for example the
average<00:03:44.319><c> speed</c>

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 align:start position:0%
average speed
 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
average speed
would<00:03:45.680><c> be</c><00:03:47.040><c> you</c><00:03:47.120><c> know</c><00:03:47.360><c> determined</c><00:03:48.000><c> by</c><00:03:48.480><c> what's</c>

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
would be you know determined by what's
 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.630 align:start position:0%
would be you know determined by what's
the<00:03:48.879><c> precise</c><00:03:49.360><c> situation</c><00:03:49.840><c> so</c><00:03:50.000><c> you</c><00:03:50.159><c> couldn't</c>

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
the precise situation so you couldn't
 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.030 align:start position:0%
the precise situation so you couldn't
predict<00:03:51.040><c> it</c><00:03:51.200><c> april</c><00:03:51.760><c> right</c><00:03:51.920><c> so</c><00:03:52.080><c> there's</c><00:03:52.319><c> no</c><00:03:52.480><c> way</c>

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
predict it april right so there's no way
 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.030 align:start position:0%
predict it april right so there's no way
you<00:03:53.200><c> just</c><00:03:53.360><c> have</c><00:03:53.519><c> to</c><00:03:53.680><c> measure</c><00:03:54.080><c> it</c>

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
you just have to measure it
 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.830 align:start position:0%
you just have to measure it
but<00:03:55.280><c> the</c><00:03:55.519><c> shape</c><00:03:55.760><c> of</c><00:03:55.920><c> these</c><00:03:56.159><c> fluctuations</c><00:03:57.680><c> the</c>

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
but the shape of these fluctuations the
 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.710 align:start position:0%
but the shape of these fluctuations the
idea<00:03:58.080><c> is</c><00:03:58.239><c> that's</c>

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
idea is that's
 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.550 align:start position:0%
idea is that's
something<00:03:59.040><c> that's</c><00:03:59.360><c> supposed</c><00:03:59.920><c> to</c><00:04:00.080><c> be</c>

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
something that's supposed to be
 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.550 align:start position:0%
something that's supposed to be
universal<00:04:01.439><c> in</c><00:04:01.599><c> the</c><00:04:01.680><c> sense</c><00:04:02.000><c> that</c><00:04:02.159><c> it</c><00:04:02.239><c> really</c>

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
universal in the sense that it really
 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.229 align:start position:0%
universal in the sense that it really
should<00:04:02.720><c> be</c><00:04:02.879><c> the</c><00:04:03.120><c> same</c>

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
should be the same
 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
should be the same

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
um the same shape whatever situation as
 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.030 align:start position:0%
um the same shape whatever situation as

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
think
 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.470 align:start position:0%
think
everything<00:04:12.640><c> you've</c><00:04:12.840><c> described</c><00:04:14.080><c> is</c>

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
everything you've described is
 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.270 align:start position:0%
everything you've described is

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
inherently random
 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.030 align:start position:0%

you<00:04:44.479><c> always</c><00:04:44.720><c> get</c><00:04:44.960><c> a</c><00:04:45.040><c> bell</c><00:04:45.360><c> curve</c>

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
you always get a bell curve

you always get a bell curve

distribution of what you get
 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.790 align:start position:0%

is always going to be a gaussian in the

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
end and so yeah
 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.550 align:start position:0%

so<00:04:52.639><c> it's</c><00:04:52.800><c> the</c><00:04:52.880><c> same</c><00:04:53.280><c> type</c><00:04:53.600><c> of</c><00:04:53.680><c> universality</c>

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
so it's the same type of universality
 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.150 align:start position:0%
so it's the same type of universality

trying to find
the<00:05:07.120><c> gaussian</c><00:05:07.759><c> equivalent</c><00:05:09.199><c> right</c><00:05:09.360><c> these</c><00:05:09.600><c> are</c>

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
the gaussian equivalent right these are
 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
the gaussian equivalent right these are
sort<00:05:09.840><c> of</c><00:05:10.000><c> the</c><00:05:10.160><c> analog</c><00:05:10.639><c> exactly</c><00:05:11.039><c> so</c><00:05:11.199><c> it's</c><00:05:11.280><c> the</c>

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
sort of the analog exactly so it's the
 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.510 align:start position:0%
sort of the analog exactly so it's the

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
the four motion of interfaces
 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.510 align:start position:0%
the four motion of interfaces
i<00:05:16.800><c> see</c><00:05:17.440><c> okay</c><00:05:17.919><c> so</c><00:05:18.080><c> let's</c><00:05:18.320><c> have</c><00:05:18.479><c> a</c><00:05:18.639><c> look</c><00:05:19.199><c> at</c><00:05:19.360><c> one</c>

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
i see okay so let's have a look at one
 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.270 align:start position:0%
i see okay so let's have a look at one
of<00:05:19.600><c> these</c><00:05:19.840><c> interfaces</c>

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
of these interfaces
 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.830 align:start position:0%
of these interfaces
okay<00:05:21.680><c> so</c><00:05:22.080><c> so</c><00:05:22.240><c> since</c><00:05:22.479><c> the</c><00:05:22.720><c> idea</c><00:05:23.120><c> is</c><00:05:23.280><c> that</c><00:05:23.520><c> the</c>

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay so so since the idea is that the
 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.230 align:start position:0%
okay so so since the idea is that the
fluctuation<00:05:24.479><c> should</c><00:05:24.639><c> always</c><00:05:24.880><c> be</c><00:05:25.039><c> the</c><00:05:25.199><c> same</c>

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
fluctuation should always be the same
 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.469 align:start position:0%
fluctuation should always be the same
well<00:05:26.400><c> it</c><00:05:26.479><c> means</c><00:05:26.800><c> if</c><00:05:26.880><c> you</c><00:05:27.039><c> take</c><00:05:27.520><c> basically</c><00:05:28.160><c> any</c>

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
well it means if you take basically any
 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.150 align:start position:0%
well it means if you take basically any
sort<00:05:28.639><c> of</c><00:05:28.720><c> mathematical</c><00:05:29.520><c> model</c>

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.749 align:start position:0%
sort of mathematical model
it<00:05:30.240><c> doesn't</c><00:05:30.560><c> have</c><00:05:30.720><c> to</c><00:05:30.880><c> have</c><00:05:31.120><c> anything</c><00:05:31.520><c> to</c><00:05:31.600><c> do</c>

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to have anything to do
 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.150 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to have anything to do
with<00:05:32.000><c> reality</c><00:05:33.120><c> as</c><00:05:33.360><c> long</c><00:05:33.600><c> as</c>

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.830 align:start position:0%
with reality as long as
it<00:05:34.320><c> has</c><00:05:34.479><c> the</c><00:05:34.639><c> same</c><00:05:34.880><c> features</c><00:05:35.280><c> so</c><00:05:35.440><c> it's</c><00:05:35.600><c> in</c><00:05:35.680><c> two</c>

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
it has the same features so it's in two
 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.310 align:start position:0%
it has the same features so it's in two
dimensions<00:05:37.120><c> there's</c><00:05:37.440><c> two</c><00:05:37.680><c> regions</c>

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 align:start position:0%

one<00:05:38.560><c> region</c><00:05:38.880><c> invades</c><00:05:39.280><c> the</c><00:05:39.440><c> other</c><00:05:39.680><c> one</c><00:05:40.000><c> and</c>

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
one region invades the other one and
 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.990 align:start position:0%
one region invades the other one and
there's<00:05:40.240><c> some</c><00:05:40.479><c> randomness</c><00:05:41.120><c> involved</c>

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's some randomness involved
 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.670 align:start position:0%
there's some randomness involved
and<00:05:42.160><c> the</c><00:05:42.320><c> randomness</c><00:05:42.880><c> that's</c><00:05:43.199><c> involved</c><00:05:43.600><c> is</c>

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the randomness that's involved is
 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.189 align:start position:0%
and the randomness that's involved is
sort<00:05:43.840><c> of</c><00:05:44.000><c> more</c><00:05:44.160><c> or</c><00:05:44.240><c> less</c><00:05:44.479><c> independent</c><00:05:45.120><c> in</c>

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
sort of more or less independent in
 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.710 align:start position:0%
sort of more or less independent in
different<00:05:45.520><c> chunks</c><00:05:45.840><c> of</c><00:05:46.000><c> space</c>

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.749 align:start position:0%
different chunks of space
right<00:05:47.840><c> and</c><00:05:48.000><c> so</c><00:05:48.160><c> what</c><00:05:48.320><c> you</c><00:05:48.479><c> do</c><00:05:48.720><c> here</c><00:05:49.120><c> is</c><00:05:49.280><c> you</c>

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
right and so what you do here is you
 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.909 align:start position:0%
right and so what you do here is you
basically<00:05:50.160><c> take</c><00:05:50.400><c> a</c><00:05:50.479><c> tetris</c><00:05:50.960><c> game</c><00:05:51.680><c> the</c>

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
basically take a tetris game the
 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.430 align:start position:0%
basically take a tetris game the
treacherous<00:05:52.400><c> brakes</c><00:05:52.639><c> are</c><00:05:52.720><c> falling</c><00:05:53.039><c> down</c><00:05:53.280><c> from</c>

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
treacherous brakes are falling down from
 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.110 align:start position:0%
treacherous brakes are falling down from
the<00:05:53.520><c> sky</c><00:05:53.840><c> but</c><00:05:54.000><c> it's</c><00:05:54.160><c> an</c><00:05:54.320><c> infinitely</c><00:05:54.800><c> wide</c>

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
the sky but it's an infinitely wide
 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.309 align:start position:0%
the sky but it's an infinitely wide
treacherous<00:05:55.600><c> game</c>

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
treacherous game
 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.830 align:start position:0%
treacherous game
and<00:05:56.400><c> we're</c><00:05:56.560><c> not</c><00:05:56.720><c> controlling</c><00:05:57.199><c> these</c><00:05:57.680><c> we</c><00:05:57.759><c> are</c>

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
and we're not controlling these we are
 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.830 align:start position:0%
and we're not controlling these we are
not<00:05:58.000><c> controlling</c><00:05:58.479><c> this</c><00:05:58.960><c> so</c><00:05:59.120><c> they</c><00:05:59.280><c> just</c><00:05:59.520><c> fall</c>

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
not controlling this so they just fall
 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.710 align:start position:0%
not controlling this so they just fall
down

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
down
 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.830 align:start position:0%
down
randomly<00:06:02.000><c> and</c><00:06:02.319><c> we</c><00:06:02.560><c> don't</c><00:06:02.800><c> play</c>

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
randomly and we don't play
 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
randomly and we don't play
and<00:06:04.160><c> they</c><00:06:04.240><c> can't</c><00:06:04.560><c> play</c><00:06:04.960><c> the</c><00:06:05.120><c> shape</c><00:06:05.360><c> of</c><00:06:05.440><c> the</c>

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
and they can't play the shape of the
 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
and they can't play the shape of the
brick<00:06:05.759><c> is</c><00:06:05.919><c> also</c><00:06:06.160><c> random</c>

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
brick is also random
 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.909 align:start position:0%
brick is also random
exactly<00:06:08.160><c> so</c><00:06:08.319><c> it's</c><00:06:08.479><c> a</c><00:06:08.880><c> standard</c><00:06:09.199><c> tetra</c><00:06:09.520><c> species</c>

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
exactly so it's a standard tetra species
 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
exactly so it's a standard tetra species
i've<00:06:10.080><c> seen</c><00:06:10.240><c> in</c><00:06:10.400><c> the</c><00:06:10.479><c> square</c>

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
i've seen in the square
 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.230 align:start position:0%
i've seen in the square
exactly<00:06:11.840><c> standard</c><00:06:12.240><c> tetris</c><00:06:12.720><c> bricks</c>

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
exactly standard tetris bricks
 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.710 align:start position:0%
exactly standard tetris bricks
random<00:06:14.639><c> orientation</c><00:06:15.440><c> okay</c><00:06:15.759><c> random</c><00:06:16.240><c> shape</c>

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.830 align:start position:0%
random orientation okay random shape
random<00:06:17.120><c> location</c>

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
random location
 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.670 align:start position:0%
random location
and<00:06:17.919><c> they</c><00:06:18.080><c> just</c><00:06:18.319><c> fall</c><00:06:18.560><c> down</c><00:06:18.880><c> and</c><00:06:18.960><c> they</c><00:06:19.199><c> pile</c><00:06:19.520><c> up</c>

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
and they just fall down and they pile up
 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.029 align:start position:0%
and they just fall down and they pile up
according<00:06:20.080><c> to</c><00:06:20.160><c> so</c><00:06:20.319><c> if</c><00:06:20.400><c> you</c><00:06:20.479><c> were</c><00:06:20.639><c> really</c>

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
according to so if you were really
 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.710 align:start position:0%
according to so if you were really
bad<00:06:21.280><c> at</c><00:06:21.440><c> tetris</c><00:06:21.840><c> it</c><00:06:22.000><c> would</c><00:06:22.080><c> look</c><00:06:22.240><c> like</c><00:06:22.400><c> this</c>

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
bad at tetris it would look like this
 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.629 align:start position:0%
bad at tetris it would look like this
exactly<00:06:23.600><c> okay</c>

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
exactly okay
 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.870 align:start position:0%
exactly okay
that's<00:06:24.960><c> right</c><00:06:25.680><c> except</c><00:06:26.080><c> that</c><00:06:26.160><c> that</c><00:06:26.479><c> one</c><00:06:26.720><c> is</c>

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's right except that that one is
 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.029 align:start position:0%
that's right except that that one is
really<00:06:27.199><c> wide</c><00:06:27.680><c> so</c><00:06:27.840><c> you</c><00:06:28.000><c> can</c><00:06:28.080><c> kind</c><00:06:28.319><c> of</c><00:06:28.479><c> zoom</c><00:06:28.800><c> out</c>

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
really wide so you can kind of zoom out
 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.309 align:start position:0%
really wide so you can kind of zoom out
a<00:06:29.120><c> bit</c><00:06:29.360><c> and</c><00:06:29.440><c> you</c><00:06:29.600><c> see</c><00:06:29.759><c> that</c><00:06:29.919><c> they've</c><00:06:30.160><c> been</c>

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
a bit and you see that they've been
 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.150 align:start position:0%
a bit and you see that they've been
falling<00:06:30.800><c> down</c>

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
falling down
 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.710 align:start position:0%
falling down
everywhere<00:06:33.039><c> right</c><00:06:33.280><c> so</c><00:06:33.440><c> you've</c><00:06:33.680><c> got</c><00:06:34.319><c> loads</c><00:06:34.639><c> and</c>

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
everywhere right so you've got loads and
 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.070 align:start position:0%
everywhere right so you've got loads and
loads<00:06:34.960><c> of</c><00:06:35.120><c> tattoo</c><00:06:35.440><c> springs</c>

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
loads of tattoo springs
 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.430 align:start position:0%
loads of tattoo springs
piling<00:06:36.479><c> up</c><00:06:37.680><c> um</c><00:06:38.080><c> and</c><00:06:38.160><c> now</c><00:06:38.400><c> here</c><00:06:38.639><c> you</c><00:06:38.800><c> really</c><00:06:39.120><c> see</c>

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
piling up um and now here you really see
 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
piling up um and now here you really see
you<00:06:39.600><c> start</c><00:06:39.919><c> to</c><00:06:40.080><c> see</c><00:06:40.240><c> that</c><00:06:40.400><c> there's</c><00:06:40.720><c> actually</c>

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
you start to see that there's actually
 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.909 align:start position:0%
you start to see that there's actually
you<00:06:41.600><c> know</c><00:06:41.840><c> sort</c><00:06:42.000><c> of</c><00:06:42.160><c> a</c><00:06:42.240><c> continuous</c><00:06:42.880><c> curve</c><00:06:43.199><c> here</c>

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
you know sort of a continuous curve here
 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.150 align:start position:0%
you know sort of a continuous curve here
yeah<00:06:44.560><c> it</c><00:06:44.880><c> looks</c><00:06:45.120><c> like</c><00:06:45.360><c> almost</c><00:06:45.520><c> like</c><00:06:45.759><c> branches</c>

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
yeah it looks like almost like branches
 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.950 align:start position:0%
yeah it looks like almost like branches
or<00:06:46.240><c> like</c><00:06:46.400><c> a</c><00:06:46.560><c> tree</c>

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
or like a tree
 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.670 align:start position:0%
or like a tree
yeah<00:06:47.759><c> growing</c><00:06:48.080><c> outwards</c><00:06:48.960><c> yeah</c><00:06:49.199><c> that's</c><00:06:49.440><c> right</c>

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah growing outwards yeah that's right
 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.029 align:start position:0%
yeah growing outwards yeah that's right
so<00:06:49.840><c> you</c><00:06:49.919><c> have</c><00:06:50.160><c> these</c><00:06:50.400><c> uh</c>

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
so you have these uh
 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:53.270 align:start position:0%
so you have these uh
these<00:06:51.280><c> kind</c><00:06:51.520><c> of</c><00:06:51.680><c> canals</c><00:06:52.319><c> forming</c><00:06:52.880><c> right</c><00:06:53.120><c> so</c>

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
these kind of canals forming right so
 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.550 align:start position:0%
these kind of canals forming right so
you<00:06:53.440><c> have</c><00:06:53.599><c> to</c><00:06:53.840><c> so</c><00:06:54.000><c> when</c><00:06:54.160><c> you</c>

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
you have to so when you
 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.510 align:start position:0%
you have to so when you
oh<00:06:54.720><c> wow</c><00:06:55.039><c> if</c><00:06:55.120><c> you</c><00:06:55.280><c> zoom</c><00:06:55.680><c> out</c><00:06:56.319><c> yeah</c><00:06:57.039><c> sometimes</c>

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
oh wow if you zoom out yeah sometimes
 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.390 align:start position:0%
oh wow if you zoom out yeah sometimes
you<00:06:57.680><c> see</c><00:06:57.840><c> these</c><00:06:58.000><c> big</c>

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
you see these big
 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.230 align:start position:0%
you see these big
and<00:06:58.479><c> that's</c><00:06:58.639><c> just</c><00:06:58.800><c> completely</c><00:06:59.199><c> random</c><00:06:59.599><c> that's</c>

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
and that's just completely random that's
 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.230 align:start position:0%
and that's just completely random that's
there's<00:07:00.400><c> no</c><00:07:00.560><c> reason</c><00:07:00.800><c> to</c><00:07:00.960><c> expect</c><00:07:01.360><c> that</c><00:07:01.599><c> or</c><00:07:01.840><c> is</c>

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to expect that or is
 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.510 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to expect that or is
um<00:07:03.199><c> no</c><00:07:03.440><c> so</c><00:07:03.599><c> it's</c><00:07:03.759><c> completely</c><00:07:04.240><c> random</c><00:07:04.720><c> but</c><00:07:05.120><c> um</c>

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
um no so it's completely random but um
 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.990 align:start position:0%
um no so it's completely random but um
i<00:07:05.599><c> mean</c><00:07:05.759><c> you</c><00:07:05.919><c> can</c><00:07:07.199><c> you</c><00:07:07.360><c> can</c><00:07:07.520><c> more</c><00:07:07.680><c> or</c><00:07:07.759><c> less</c>

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
i mean you can you can more or less
 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.830 align:start position:0%
i mean you can you can more or less
figure<00:07:08.319><c> out</c><00:07:08.560><c> why</c><00:07:08.880><c> these</c><00:07:09.120><c> canals</c>

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
figure out why these canals
 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.749 align:start position:0%
figure out why these canals
form<00:07:10.400><c> right</c><00:07:10.720><c> because</c><00:07:10.960><c> it's</c><00:07:11.280><c> it's</c><00:07:11.520><c> when</c><00:07:11.680><c> you</c>

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
form right because it's it's when you
 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.350 align:start position:0%
form right because it's it's when you
have<00:07:11.919><c> a</c><00:07:12.000><c> big</c><00:07:12.240><c> overhang</c>

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
have a big overhang
 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.189 align:start position:0%
have a big overhang
so<00:07:13.599><c> if</c><00:07:13.680><c> you</c><00:07:13.759><c> have</c><00:07:13.919><c> a</c><00:07:14.000><c> big</c><00:07:14.240><c> overhand</c><00:07:14.800><c> then</c><00:07:15.039><c> it's</c>

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
so if you have a big overhand then it's
 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.029 align:start position:0%
so if you have a big overhand then it's
going<00:07:15.360><c> to</c><00:07:15.520><c> persist</c><00:07:16.000><c> for</c><00:07:16.240><c> a</c><00:07:16.319><c> while</c><00:07:16.720><c> but</c><00:07:16.880><c> it's</c>

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
going to persist for a while but it's
 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.309 align:start position:0%
going to persist for a while but it's
essentially<00:07:17.599><c> going</c><00:07:17.759><c> to</c><00:07:18.000><c> move</c><00:07:18.479><c> right</c><00:07:18.720><c> because</c>

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
essentially going to move right because
 

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:22.629 align:start position:0%
essentially going to move right because
there's<00:07:20.560><c> an</c><00:07:20.720><c> overhang</c><00:07:21.759><c> then</c><00:07:22.000><c> bricks</c><00:07:22.400><c> fall</c>

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
there's an overhang then bricks fall
 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.550 align:start position:0%
there's an overhang then bricks fall
down<00:07:23.280><c> but</c><00:07:23.440><c> then</c><00:07:23.599><c> they</c><00:07:23.759><c> sort</c><00:07:23.919><c> of</c><00:07:24.080><c> pile</c><00:07:24.400><c> up</c>

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
down but then they sort of pile up
 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.510 align:start position:0%
down but then they sort of pile up
diagonally

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
diagonally
 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.270 align:start position:0%
diagonally
right<00:07:25.840><c> and</c><00:07:25.919><c> so</c><00:07:26.080><c> it</c><00:07:26.160><c> makes</c><00:07:26.400><c> the</c><00:07:26.560><c> overhand</c><00:07:27.120><c> sort</c>

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
right and so it makes the overhand sort
 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.950 align:start position:0%
right and so it makes the overhand sort
of<00:07:27.440><c> move</c><00:07:27.759><c> up</c><00:07:27.919><c> diagonally</c>

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
of move up diagonally
 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.950 align:start position:0%
of move up diagonally
and<00:07:29.039><c> that's</c><00:07:29.360><c> essentially</c><00:07:30.000><c> these</c><00:07:30.479><c> channels</c>

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that's essentially these channels
 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.710 align:start position:0%
and that's essentially these channels
that<00:07:31.120><c> you</c><00:07:31.360><c> see</c><00:07:31.680><c> right</c><00:07:31.919><c> it's</c><00:07:32.160><c> kind</c><00:07:32.319><c> of</c><00:07:32.479><c> these</c>

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
that you see right it's kind of these
 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.309 align:start position:0%
that you see right it's kind of these
overhangs

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
overhangs
 

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.629 align:start position:0%
overhangs
is<00:07:34.479><c> that</c><00:07:34.639><c> particularly</c><00:07:35.199><c> too</c><00:07:35.440><c> tetris</c><00:07:36.400><c> like</c>

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
is that particularly too tetris like
 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.469 align:start position:0%
is that particularly too tetris like
because<00:07:36.960><c> of</c><00:07:37.039><c> the</c><00:07:37.199><c> shape</c><00:07:37.440><c> of</c><00:07:37.520><c> the</c><00:07:37.599><c> brick</c>

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
because of the shape of the brick
 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:41.589 align:start position:0%
because of the shape of the brick
well<00:07:38.800><c> it's</c><00:07:39.039><c> because</c><00:07:39.440><c> the</c><00:07:39.919><c> right</c><00:07:40.160><c> so</c><00:07:41.120><c> so</c><00:07:41.280><c> if</c><00:07:41.440><c> the</c>

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
well it's because the right so so if the
 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
well it's because the right so so if the
bricks<00:07:41.919><c> were</c><00:07:42.080><c> just</c><00:07:42.319><c> single</c><00:07:42.639><c> breaks</c>

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
bricks were just single breaks
 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.510 align:start position:0%
bricks were just single breaks
and<00:07:43.759><c> they</c><00:07:43.919><c> just</c><00:07:44.160><c> pile</c><00:07:44.479><c> up</c><00:07:44.879><c> then</c><00:07:45.039><c> that</c><00:07:45.280><c> wouldn't</c>

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
and they just pile up then that wouldn't
 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.950 align:start position:0%
and they just pile up then that wouldn't
be<00:07:45.680><c> interesting</c><00:07:46.240><c> in</c><00:07:46.400><c> a</c><00:07:46.479><c> way</c>

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
be interesting in a way
 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.029 align:start position:0%
be interesting in a way
right<00:07:47.199><c> because</c><00:07:48.240><c> because</c><00:07:48.479><c> then</c><00:07:48.879><c> there</c>

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
right because because then there
 

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:50.869 align:start position:0%
right because because then there
wouldn't<00:07:49.280><c> be</c><00:07:49.520><c> any</c><00:07:49.759><c> interaction</c>

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any interaction
 

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.430 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any interaction
between<00:07:51.599><c> between</c><00:07:51.919><c> the</c><00:07:52.080><c> neighbors</c><00:07:53.280><c> what</c>

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
between between the neighbors what
 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.430 align:start position:0%
between between the neighbors what
happens<00:07:53.759><c> at</c><00:07:54.000><c> every</c><00:07:54.240><c> point</c><00:07:54.560><c> would</c><00:07:54.720><c> just</c><00:07:55.039><c> be</c>

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
happens at every point would just be
 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.350 align:start position:0%
happens at every point would just be
completely<00:07:56.000><c> independent</c><00:07:56.720><c> from</c><00:07:56.879><c> what</c><00:07:57.039><c> happens</c>

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
completely independent from what happens
 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.110 align:start position:0%
completely independent from what happens
at<00:07:57.520><c> any</c><00:07:57.680><c> other</c><00:07:58.000><c> point</c>

00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
at any other point
 

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.550 align:start position:0%
at any other point
and<00:07:59.280><c> then</c><00:07:59.440><c> you</c><00:07:59.520><c> wouldn't</c><00:07:59.840><c> expect</c><00:08:00.160><c> anything</c>

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
and then you wouldn't expect anything
 

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
and then you wouldn't expect anything
interesting<00:08:01.120><c> so</c><00:08:01.280><c> here</c><00:08:01.440><c> you</c><00:08:01.520><c> can</c><00:08:01.680><c> actually</c>

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
interesting so here you can actually
 

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.629 align:start position:0%
interesting so here you can actually
change<00:08:02.800><c> the</c><00:08:03.039><c> shape</c><00:08:03.360><c> of</c><00:08:03.520><c> the</c><00:08:03.759><c> brick</c><00:08:04.160><c> so</c><00:08:04.479><c> for</c>

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
change the shape of the brick so for
 

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
change the shape of the brick so for
example<00:08:05.199><c> if</c><00:08:05.280><c> you</c><00:08:05.520><c> do</c>

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
example if you do
 

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.189 align:start position:0%
example if you do
this<00:08:07.280><c> so</c><00:08:07.520><c> now</c><00:08:07.759><c> it's</c><00:08:07.919><c> tetris</c><00:08:08.400><c> with</c><00:08:08.560><c> only</c><00:08:08.879><c> square</c>

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
this so now it's tetris with only square
 

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.629 align:start position:0%
this so now it's tetris with only square
bricks

00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
bricks
 

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:13.749 align:start position:0%
bricks
all<00:08:10.800><c> right</c><00:08:11.120><c> so</c><00:08:11.680><c> so</c><00:08:12.000><c> here</c>

00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
all right so so here
 

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.430 align:start position:0%
all right so so here
right<00:08:14.000><c> so</c><00:08:14.160><c> it's</c><00:08:14.319><c> only</c><00:08:14.639><c> square</c><00:08:14.960><c> bricks</c><00:08:15.280><c> but</c>

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
right so it's only square bricks but
 

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.790 align:start position:0%
right so it's only square bricks but
there<00:08:15.520><c> are</c><00:08:15.680><c> two</c><00:08:15.840><c> by</c><00:08:16.080><c> two</c><00:08:16.319><c> bricks</c>

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
there are two by two bricks
 

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.230 align:start position:0%
there are two by two bricks
every<00:08:17.039><c> right</c><00:08:17.280><c> so</c><00:08:17.440><c> they</c><00:08:17.599><c> can</c><00:08:17.759><c> actually</c>

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
every right so they can actually
 

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.830 align:start position:0%
every right so they can actually
everyone<00:08:18.639><c> is</c><00:08:18.800><c> a</c><00:08:18.960><c> square</c>

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
everyone is a square
 

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.749 align:start position:0%
everyone is a square
but<00:08:20.000><c> they're</c><00:08:20.160><c> all</c><00:08:20.400><c> two</c><00:08:20.639><c> by</c><00:08:20.960><c> two</c><00:08:21.199><c> so</c><00:08:21.360><c> they</c><00:08:21.520><c> can</c>

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
but they're all two by two so they can
 

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:23.350 align:start position:0%
but they're all two by two so they can
still<00:08:22.080><c> so</c><00:08:22.240><c> they</c><00:08:22.400><c> can</c><00:08:22.639><c> still</c><00:08:22.960><c> pile</c><00:08:23.199><c> up</c>

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
still so they can still pile up
 

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.230 align:start position:0%
still so they can still pile up
diagonally

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
diagonally
 

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.589 align:start position:0%
diagonally
right<00:08:24.400><c> so</c><00:08:24.560><c> they</c><00:08:24.720><c> can</c><00:08:24.879><c> still</c><00:08:25.120><c> form</c><00:08:25.360><c> these</c>

00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
right so they can still form these
 

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:27.510 align:start position:0%
right so they can still form these
channels<00:08:26.080><c> for</c><00:08:26.240><c> example</c><00:08:26.720><c> right</c><00:08:27.120><c> because</c><00:08:27.360><c> if</c>

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
channels for example right because if
 

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.189 align:start position:0%
channels for example right because if
they<00:08:27.599><c> were</c><00:08:27.840><c> one</c><00:08:28.000><c> by</c><00:08:28.240><c> one</c>

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
they were one by one
 

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.950 align:start position:0%
they were one by one
then<00:08:29.360><c> they</c><00:08:29.520><c> couldn't</c><00:08:29.840><c> pile</c><00:08:30.080><c> up</c><00:08:30.160><c> diagonally</c>

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
then they couldn't pile up diagonally
 

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.230 align:start position:0%
then they couldn't pile up diagonally
yes

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.589 align:start position:0%
yes
so<00:08:32.320><c> then</c><00:08:32.479><c> it</c><00:08:32.640><c> would</c><00:08:32.719><c> be</c><00:08:32.880><c> very</c><00:08:33.039><c> good</c><00:08:33.279><c> so</c><00:08:33.440><c> this</c>

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
so then it would be very good so this
 

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:35.350 align:start position:0%
so then it would be very good so this
one's<00:08:33.839><c> very</c><00:08:34.080><c> similar</c><00:08:34.560><c> so</c><00:08:34.719><c> this</c><00:08:34.880><c> one's</c><00:08:35.120><c> very</c>

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
one's very similar so this one's very
 

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.149 align:start position:0%
one's very similar so this one's very
similar

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
similar
 

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.029 align:start position:0%
similar
right<00:08:36.320><c> so</c><00:08:36.479><c> you</c><00:08:36.719><c> see</c><00:08:36.880><c> you</c><00:08:37.039><c> zoom</c><00:08:37.360><c> out</c><00:08:38.640><c> so</c><00:08:38.800><c> here</c>

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
right so you see you zoom out so here
 

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.550 align:start position:0%
right so you see you zoom out so here
you<00:08:39.200><c> still</c><00:08:39.440><c> see</c><00:08:39.599><c> the</c><00:08:39.760><c> difference</c><00:08:40.159><c> it</c><00:08:40.240><c> looks</c><00:08:40.479><c> a</c>

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
you still see the difference it looks a
 

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.909 align:start position:0%
you still see the difference it looks a
little<00:08:40.719><c> bit</c><00:08:40.880><c> different</c><00:08:41.360><c> because</c><00:08:41.519><c> they're</c><00:08:41.760><c> all</c>

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
little bit different because they're all
 

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.589 align:start position:0%
little bit different because they're all
the<00:08:42.080><c> same</c><00:08:42.399><c> bricks</c>

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
the same bricks
 

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:45.829 align:start position:0%
the same bricks
but<00:08:43.919><c> you</c><00:08:44.000><c> know</c><00:08:44.159><c> by</c><00:08:44.320><c> the</c><00:08:44.480><c> time</c><00:08:44.720><c> you're</c><00:08:45.040><c> here</c><00:08:45.680><c> you</c>

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
but you know by the time you're here you
 

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:47.030 align:start position:0%
but you know by the time you're here you
don't<00:08:46.000><c> really</c><00:08:46.240><c> see</c><00:08:46.480><c> the</c><00:08:46.560><c> difference</c>

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't really see the difference
 

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.269 align:start position:0%
don't really see the difference
no<00:08:47.200><c> that</c><00:08:47.680><c> to</c><00:08:47.760><c> me</c><00:08:47.920><c> that</c><00:08:48.000><c> looks</c><00:08:48.240><c> the</c><00:08:48.320><c> same</c><00:08:48.560><c> yeah</c>

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
no that to me that looks the same yeah
 

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.790 align:start position:0%
no that to me that looks the same yeah
yeah<00:08:49.519><c> it</c><00:08:49.600><c> looks</c><00:08:49.760><c> the</c><00:08:49.920><c> same</c><00:08:50.160><c> whereas</c><00:08:50.560><c> if</c><00:08:50.640><c> you</c>

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it looks the same whereas if you
 

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.990 align:start position:0%
yeah it looks the same whereas if you
did<00:08:51.040><c> the</c>

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
did the
 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.070 align:start position:0%
did the
just<00:08:52.320><c> single</c><00:08:52.640><c> break</c><00:08:53.040><c> so</c><00:08:53.200><c> you</c><00:08:53.279><c> can</c><00:08:53.440><c> do</c><00:08:53.600><c> that</c><00:08:53.920><c> as</c>

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
just single break so you can do that as
 

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.269 align:start position:0%
just single break so you can do that as
well<00:08:54.399><c> and</c><00:08:54.480><c> then</c><00:08:54.720><c> it</c><00:08:54.800><c> looks</c><00:08:55.040><c> very</c>

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
well and then it looks very
 

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:57.509 align:start position:0%
well and then it looks very
uninteresting<00:08:56.080><c> so</c><00:08:56.240><c> if</c><00:08:56.320><c> we</c><00:08:56.399><c> do</c><00:08:56.560><c> the</c><00:08:56.720><c> single</c><00:08:57.120><c> one</c>

00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
uninteresting so if we do the single one
 

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:00.389 align:start position:0%
uninteresting so if we do the single one
and<00:08:57.760><c> i</c><00:08:57.920><c> i</c><00:08:58.160><c> reset</c><00:08:58.640><c> the</c><00:08:58.800><c> whole</c><00:08:59.040><c> thing</c><00:08:59.920><c> this</c><00:09:00.160><c> is</c><00:09:00.320><c> a</c>

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
and i i reset the whole thing this is a
 

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:02.070 align:start position:0%
and i i reset the whole thing this is a
single<00:09:00.720><c> square</c><00:09:00.959><c> so</c><00:09:01.120><c> now</c><00:09:01.360><c> it's</c><00:09:01.519><c> just</c><00:09:01.760><c> single</c>

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
single square so now it's just single
 

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.269 align:start position:0%
single square so now it's just single
squares

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
squares
 

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:06.310 align:start position:0%
squares
um<00:09:03.920><c> and</c><00:09:04.000><c> you</c><00:09:04.160><c> see</c><00:09:04.399><c> so</c><00:09:04.560><c> it</c><00:09:04.720><c> just</c><00:09:05.600><c> goes</c><00:09:05.920><c> up</c><00:09:06.080><c> like</c>

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
um and you see so it just goes up like
 

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.750 align:start position:0%
um and you see so it just goes up like
that<00:09:06.720><c> but</c><00:09:06.959><c> you</c><00:09:07.120><c> don't</c>

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
that but you don't
 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.110 align:start position:0%
that but you don't
you<00:09:07.920><c> don't</c><00:09:08.080><c> have</c><00:09:08.320><c> anything</c><00:09:08.640><c> interested</c><00:09:09.040><c> in</c>

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
you don't have anything interested in
 

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.389 align:start position:0%
you don't have anything interested in
forming<00:09:09.440><c> of</c><00:09:09.600><c> course</c><00:09:09.760><c> there's</c><00:09:10.000><c> no</c><00:09:10.160><c> hole</c>

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
forming of course there's no hole
 

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:12.150 align:start position:0%
forming of course there's no hole
there's<00:09:10.640><c> no</c><00:09:10.800><c> gaps</c><00:09:11.120><c> anymore</c><00:09:11.519><c> because</c><00:09:11.839><c> you</c><00:09:11.920><c> just</c>

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's no gaps anymore because you just
 

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.430 align:start position:0%
there's no gaps anymore because you just
pile<00:09:12.399><c> up</c><00:09:12.560><c> like</c><00:09:12.800><c> that</c>

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
pile up like that
 

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.430 align:start position:0%
pile up like that
is<00:09:13.519><c> there</c><00:09:13.680><c> a</c><00:09:13.760><c> reason</c><00:09:14.000><c> for</c><00:09:14.160><c> the</c><00:09:14.320><c> spikes</c><00:09:15.120><c> is</c><00:09:15.200><c> this</c>

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
is there a reason for the spikes is this
 

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.870 align:start position:0%
is there a reason for the spikes is this
yes<00:09:15.760><c> because</c><00:09:16.320><c> um</c>

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes because um
 

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.509 align:start position:0%
yes because um
at<00:09:17.120><c> every</c><00:09:17.519><c> point</c><00:09:18.480><c> you</c><00:09:18.640><c> have</c><00:09:18.880><c> something</c><00:09:19.200><c> like</c>

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
at every point you have something like
 

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:20.070 align:start position:0%
at every point you have something like
uh

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.110 align:start position:0%
uh
you<00:09:20.240><c> just</c><00:09:20.560><c> add</c><00:09:20.800><c> up</c><00:09:21.279><c> independent</c><00:09:21.839><c> numbers</c>

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
you just add up independent numbers
 

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.190 align:start position:0%
you just add up independent numbers
and<00:09:23.519><c> so</c><00:09:23.680><c> you</c><00:09:23.839><c> have</c><00:09:24.000><c> a</c><00:09:24.160><c> law</c><00:09:24.320><c> of</c><00:09:24.399><c> large</c><00:09:24.720><c> numbers</c>

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
and so you have a law of large numbers
 

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.630 align:start position:0%
and so you have a law of large numbers
which<00:09:25.440><c> is</c><00:09:25.600><c> the</c><00:09:25.839><c> you</c><00:09:26.000><c> know</c>

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
which is the you know
 

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.269 align:start position:0%
which is the you know
which<00:09:26.880><c> is</c><00:09:26.959><c> sort</c><00:09:27.120><c> of</c><00:09:27.279><c> the</c><00:09:27.440><c> average</c><00:09:27.839><c> height</c><00:09:29.200><c> and</c>

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
which is sort of the average height and
 

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:31.030 align:start position:0%
which is sort of the average height and
then<00:09:29.440><c> you</c><00:09:29.519><c> have</c><00:09:29.680><c> a</c><00:09:29.760><c> central</c><00:09:30.080><c> limit</c><00:09:30.399><c> theorem</c>

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
then you have a central limit theorem
 

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.190 align:start position:0%
then you have a central limit theorem
which<00:09:31.360><c> tells</c><00:09:31.680><c> you</c><00:09:32.160><c> kind</c><00:09:32.320><c> of</c><00:09:32.640><c> the</c><00:09:32.800><c> height</c><00:09:33.120><c> of</c>

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
which tells you kind of the height of
 

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.550 align:start position:0%
which tells you kind of the height of
these<00:09:33.440><c> spikes</c>

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
these spikes
 

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.990 align:start position:0%
these spikes
is<00:09:34.720><c> basically</c><00:09:35.200><c> about</c><00:09:35.519><c> the</c><00:09:35.600><c> standard</c>

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
is basically about the standard
 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.670 align:start position:0%
is basically about the standard
deviation<00:09:36.560><c> of</c><00:09:36.640><c> the</c><00:09:36.800><c> gaussian</c><00:09:37.200><c> that</c><00:09:37.360><c> you</c><00:09:37.519><c> see</c>

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
deviation of the gaussian that you see
 

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
deviation of the gaussian that you see
in<00:09:37.760><c> the</c><00:09:37.839><c> center</c><00:09:38.080><c> of</c><00:09:38.160><c> the</c><00:09:38.320><c> nectar</c><00:09:38.720><c> yeah</c>

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the center of the nectar yeah
 

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.470 align:start position:0%
in the center of the nectar yeah
fantastic<00:09:39.519><c> because</c><00:09:39.600><c> they</c><00:09:39.680><c> do</c><00:09:39.839><c> look</c><00:09:40.080><c> about</c><00:09:40.399><c> the</c>

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
fantastic because they do look about the
 

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.070 align:start position:0%
fantastic because they do look about the
same<00:09:40.720><c> up</c><00:09:40.880><c> and</c><00:09:41.040><c> down</c><00:09:41.200><c> yeah</c><00:09:41.440><c> you've</c><00:09:41.600><c> said</c><00:09:41.839><c> that</c>

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
same up and down yeah you've said that
 

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.550 align:start position:0%
same up and down yeah you've said that
yeah

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.230 align:start position:0%
yeah
but<00:09:42.800><c> you</c><00:09:42.880><c> see</c><00:09:43.040><c> that</c><00:09:43.440><c> they</c><00:09:43.600><c> get</c><00:09:43.839><c> larger</c><00:09:44.160><c> and</c>

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
but you see that they get larger and
 

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.470 align:start position:0%
but you see that they get larger and
larger<00:09:44.640><c> because</c><00:09:44.880><c> of</c><00:09:45.040><c> the</c><00:09:45.519><c> square</c><00:09:45.839><c> root</c><00:09:46.080><c> of</c><00:09:46.240><c> n</c>

i<00:09:53.600><c> already</c><00:09:53.839><c> liked</c><00:09:54.160><c> the</c><00:09:54.240><c> central</c><00:09:54.560><c> limit</c>

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
i already liked the central limit
 

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.550 align:start position:0%
i already liked the central limit
theorem<00:09:55.279><c> but</c><00:09:55.440><c> after</c><00:09:55.680><c> seeing</c><00:09:55.920><c> this</c><00:09:56.080><c> i</c><00:09:56.160><c> now</c><00:09:56.320><c> like</c>

theorem but after seeing this i now like
 

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
theorem but after seeing this i now like

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
it even more like this is
 

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.710 align:start position:0%
it even more like this is
i'm<00:09:58.880><c> going</c><00:09:59.040><c> to</c><00:09:59.200><c> use</c><00:09:59.519><c> this</c><00:09:59.760><c> to</c><00:09:59.920><c> teach</c><00:10:00.160><c> this</c><00:10:00.480><c> this</c>

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use this to teach this this
 

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.990 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use this to teach this this
is<00:10:00.880><c> amazing</c><00:10:01.519><c> so</c>

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
is amazing so
 

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.949 align:start position:0%
is amazing so
so<00:10:02.240><c> one</c><00:10:02.480><c> thing</c><00:10:02.640><c> you</c><00:10:02.800><c> can</c><00:10:02.959><c> do</c><00:10:03.200><c> so</c><00:10:03.440><c> this</c><00:10:03.680><c> one</c><00:10:04.640><c> is</c>

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
so one thing you can do so this one is
 

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:06.550 align:start position:0%
so one thing you can do so this one is
also<00:10:05.360><c> single</c><00:10:05.839><c> breaks</c>

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
also single breaks
 

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.790 align:start position:0%
also single breaks
but<00:10:06.880><c> this</c><00:10:07.200><c> time</c><00:10:07.519><c> the</c><00:10:07.680><c> single</c><00:10:08.000><c> bricks</c><00:10:08.320><c> can</c><00:10:08.560><c> also</c>

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
but this time the single bricks can also
 

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.470 align:start position:0%
but this time the single bricks can also
stick<00:10:09.120><c> to</c><00:10:09.279><c> the</c><00:10:09.440><c> neighbors</c>

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
stick to the neighbors
 

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.069 align:start position:0%
stick to the neighbors
right<00:10:10.880><c> and</c><00:10:11.040><c> then</c><00:10:11.279><c> it's</c><00:10:11.440><c> really</c><00:10:11.680><c> much</c><00:10:11.920><c> more</c>

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
right and then it's really much more
 

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:13.990 align:start position:0%
right and then it's really much more
like<00:10:12.240><c> tetris</c><00:10:12.720><c> again</c><00:10:13.279><c> right</c><00:10:13.600><c> because</c><00:10:13.839><c> then</c>

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
like tetris again right because then
 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.790 align:start position:0%
like tetris again right because then
they<00:10:14.160><c> can</c><00:10:14.320><c> again</c>

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
they can again
 

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.630 align:start position:0%
they can again
grow<00:10:15.120><c> they</c><00:10:15.279><c> can</c><00:10:15.519><c> grow</c><00:10:15.760><c> that</c><00:10:15.920><c> i</c><00:10:16.000><c> can</c><00:10:16.160><c> delay</c>

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
grow they can grow that i can delay
 

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.150 align:start position:0%
grow they can grow that i can delay
we're<00:10:16.800><c> seeing</c><00:10:17.040><c> the</c><00:10:17.120><c> gaps</c><00:10:17.519><c> and</c><00:10:17.680><c> you</c><00:10:17.839><c> can</c><00:10:18.000><c> see</c>

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the gaps and you can see
 

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the gaps and you can see
the<00:10:18.320><c> gaps</c><00:10:18.640><c> you</c><00:10:18.720><c> see</c><00:10:18.959><c> the</c><00:10:19.040><c> same</c><00:10:19.279><c> sort</c><00:10:19.440><c> of</c><00:10:19.600><c> thing</c>

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
the gaps you see the same sort of thing
 

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.190 align:start position:0%
the gaps you see the same sort of thing
right<00:10:20.160><c> so</c>

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
right so
 

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.990 align:start position:0%
right so
so<00:10:21.440><c> this</c><00:10:21.680><c> time</c><00:10:22.560><c> so</c><00:10:22.800><c> if</c><00:10:22.880><c> we</c><00:10:23.040><c> just</c><00:10:23.360><c> look</c><00:10:23.600><c> at</c><00:10:23.760><c> what</c>

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
so this time so if we just look at what
 

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.110 align:start position:0%
so this time so if we just look at what
happens

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
happens
 

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.509 align:start position:0%
happens
you<00:10:25.200><c> see</c><00:10:25.360><c> they</c><00:10:25.600><c> fall</c><00:10:25.839><c> down</c><00:10:26.800><c> but</c><00:10:26.880><c> they</c><00:10:27.120><c> actually</c>

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
you see they fall down but they actually
 

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:29.110 align:start position:0%
you see they fall down but they actually
stick<00:10:27.920><c> they</c><00:10:28.079><c> stick</c><00:10:28.399><c> to</c><00:10:28.560><c> it</c><00:10:28.720><c> right</c><00:10:28.959><c> it's</c><00:10:29.040><c> like</c>

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
stick they stick to it right it's like
 

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.990 align:start position:0%
stick they stick to it right it's like
they're<00:10:29.200><c> magnetic</c>

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're magnetic
 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.509 align:start position:0%
they're magnetic
exactly<00:10:32.079><c> yeah</c>

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah
 

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:35.829 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah
nice<00:10:34.000><c> okay</c><00:10:34.399><c> see</c><00:10:34.640><c> and</c><00:10:34.720><c> then</c><00:10:35.200><c> you</c><00:10:35.360><c> zoom</c><00:10:35.600><c> out</c>

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
nice okay see and then you zoom out
 

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:37.430 align:start position:0%
nice okay see and then you zoom out
again<00:10:36.079><c> it</c><00:10:36.240><c> looks</c><00:10:36.480><c> basically</c><00:10:36.880><c> the</c><00:10:37.040><c> same</c><00:10:37.279><c> as</c>

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
again it looks basically the same as
 

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.110 align:start position:0%
again it looks basically the same as
tetris

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
tetris
 

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.829 align:start position:0%
tetris
right<00:10:39.440><c> so</c><00:10:39.760><c> one</c><00:10:40.480><c> so</c><00:10:40.640><c> as</c><00:10:40.800><c> fun</c><00:10:41.040><c> as</c><00:10:41.200><c> it</c><00:10:41.279><c> is</c><00:10:41.440><c> to</c><00:10:41.600><c> use</c>

00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
right so one so as fun as it is to use
 

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.350 align:start position:0%
right so one so as fun as it is to use
the<00:10:42.000><c> tetris</c><00:10:42.399><c> bricks</c><00:10:42.720><c> there's</c><00:10:42.880><c> nothing</c><00:10:43.200><c> but</c>

there's a lot of physical literature on
 

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.630 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of physical literature on

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
this one which is called ballistic
 

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.750 align:start position:0%
this one which is called ballistic
deposition<00:10:57.279><c> so</c><00:10:57.440><c> that's</c>

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
deposition so that's
 

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.949 align:start position:0%

that's<00:10:58.000><c> the</c><00:10:58.160><c> one</c><00:10:58.320><c> where</c><00:10:58.480><c> you</c><00:10:58.640><c> just</c><00:10:58.800><c> have</c>

00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
that's the one where you just have
 

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:00.389 align:start position:0%
that's the one where you just have
single<00:10:59.279><c> bricks</c><00:10:59.680><c> but</c><00:10:59.760><c> they</c><00:10:59.920><c> stick</c><00:11:00.240><c> to</c>

00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
single bricks but they stick to
 

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
