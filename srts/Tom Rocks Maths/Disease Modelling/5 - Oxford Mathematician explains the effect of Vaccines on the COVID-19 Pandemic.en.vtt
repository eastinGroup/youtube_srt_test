00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
equation so the rate of change
 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.149 align:start position:0%
equation so the rate of change
of<00:01:50.960><c> a</c><00:01:51.040><c> number</c><00:01:51.280><c> of</c><00:01:51.439><c> effectives</c><00:01:53.200><c> which</c><00:01:53.680><c> we</c><00:01:53.920><c> had</c>

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
of a number of effectives which we had
 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.510 align:start position:0%
of a number of effectives which we had
was<00:01:54.399><c> equal</c>

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
was equal
 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.709 align:start position:0%
was equal
to<00:01:55.840><c> this</c><00:01:56.320><c> expression</c><00:01:57.680><c> i</c><00:01:58.240><c> times</c>

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 align:start position:0%

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
rs minus s
 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.030 align:start position:0%
rs minus s
we<00:02:02.079><c> saw</c><00:02:02.399><c> that</c><00:02:02.880><c> for</c><00:02:03.040><c> the</c><00:02:03.200><c> transmission</c><00:02:03.759><c> to</c><00:02:04.000><c> stop</c>

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
we saw that for the transmission to stop
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.350 align:start position:0%
we saw that for the transmission to stop
this<00:02:05.360><c> rate</c><00:02:05.600><c> of</c><00:02:05.680><c> change</c><00:02:06.000><c> has</c><00:02:06.079><c> to</c><00:02:06.159><c> be</c><00:02:06.399><c> negative</c>

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
this rate of change has to be negative
 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.510 align:start position:0%
this rate of change has to be negative
so<00:02:07.520><c> the</c><00:02:07.759><c> number</c><00:02:08.000><c> of</c><00:02:08.160><c> people</c><00:02:08.399><c> with</c><00:02:08.640><c> the</c><00:02:08.800><c> disease</c>

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
so the number of people with the disease
 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.949 align:start position:0%
so the number of people with the disease
must<00:02:09.840><c> be</c><00:02:10.000><c> decreasing</c>

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 align:start position:0%
must be decreasing
 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.589 align:start position:0%
must be decreasing
so<00:02:11.120><c> it</c><00:02:11.200><c> can</c><00:02:11.360><c> go</c><00:02:11.520><c> down</c><00:02:11.760><c> to</c><00:02:11.920><c> zero</c><00:02:13.200><c> pandering</c>

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
so it can go down to zero pandering
 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.550 align:start position:0%
so it can go down to zero pandering
stops

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
stops
 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.710 align:start position:0%
stops
sounds<00:02:14.879><c> good</c><00:02:15.520><c> so</c><00:02:16.160><c> for</c><00:02:16.319><c> that</c><00:02:16.560><c> to</c><00:02:16.640><c> be</c><00:02:16.800><c> negative</c>

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
sounds good so for that to be negative
 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.190 align:start position:0%
sounds good so for that to be negative
we<00:02:19.040><c> found</c><00:02:19.360><c> that</c><00:02:19.840><c> that</c><00:02:20.080><c> means</c><00:02:20.480><c> this</c><00:02:20.720><c> thing</c><00:02:20.959><c> must</c>

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
we found that that means this thing must
 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.550 align:start position:0%
we found that that means this thing must
be<00:02:21.360><c> negative</c>

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
be negative
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.670 align:start position:0%
be negative
which<00:02:22.800><c> we</c><00:02:22.959><c> arranged</c><00:02:24.400><c> to</c><00:02:24.560><c> give</c><00:02:24.879><c> us</c>

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
which we arranged to give us
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.869 align:start position:0%
which we arranged to give us
r<00:02:25.920><c> s</c><00:02:26.160><c> over</c><00:02:26.480><c> a</c><00:02:27.760><c> was</c><00:02:28.080><c> less</c><00:02:28.319><c> than</c>

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 align:start position:0%
r s over a was less than
 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.150 align:start position:0%
r s over a was less than
one<00:02:30.319><c> and</c><00:02:30.480><c> then</c><00:02:30.800><c> we</c><00:02:30.959><c> defined</c><00:02:31.760><c> this</c>

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
to<00:02:34.319><c> be</c><00:02:35.680><c> this</c><00:02:35.840><c> parameter</c><00:02:36.400><c> capital</c><00:02:36.879><c> r</c>

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
to be this parameter capital r
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.350 align:start position:0%
to be this parameter capital r
so<00:02:37.840><c> this</c><00:02:38.000><c> is</c><00:02:38.080><c> the</c><00:02:38.319><c> the</c><00:02:38.480><c> r</c><00:02:38.720><c> number</c><00:02:39.040><c> that</c><00:02:39.200><c> we're</c>

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
so this is the the r number that we're
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.030 align:start position:0%
so this is the the r number that we're
always<00:02:39.599><c> hearing</c><00:02:39.920><c> about</c><00:02:40.239><c> on</c><00:02:40.319><c> the</c><00:02:40.480><c> news</c>

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
always hearing about on the news
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.309 align:start position:0%
always hearing about on the news
exactly<00:02:42.640><c> yes</c><00:02:42.879><c> so</c><00:02:43.040><c> this</c><00:02:43.280><c> is</c><00:02:43.440><c> why</c>

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
exactly yes so this is why
 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.309 align:start position:0%
exactly yes so this is why
it's<00:02:44.640><c> talked</c><00:02:44.879><c> about</c><00:02:45.360><c> as</c><00:02:45.519><c> you</c><00:02:45.760><c> said</c><00:02:46.000><c> in</c><00:02:46.160><c> the</c>

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's talked about as you said in the
 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.390 align:start position:0%
it's talked about as you said in the
news<00:02:46.720><c> for</c><00:02:46.879><c> r</c><00:02:47.040><c> to</c><00:02:47.200><c> be</c><00:02:47.280><c> less</c><00:02:47.519><c> than</c><00:02:47.680><c> one</c>

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
news for r to be less than one
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.710 align:start position:0%
news for r to be less than one
for<00:02:48.720><c> the</c><00:02:49.280><c> pandemic</c><00:02:49.760><c> to</c><00:02:49.920><c> stop</c><00:02:50.239><c> and</c><00:02:50.319><c> the</c><00:02:50.400><c> disease</c>

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
for the pandemic to stop and the disease
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.990 align:start position:0%
for the pandemic to stop and the disease
spread<00:02:50.959><c> to</c><00:02:51.040><c> stop</c>

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
spread to stop
 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.670 align:start position:0%
spread to stop
so<00:02:53.200><c> how</c><00:02:53.440><c> is</c><00:02:53.760><c> this</c><00:02:54.080><c> going</c><00:02:54.319><c> to</c><00:02:54.400><c> be</c><00:02:54.560><c> affected</c>

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
so how is this going to be affected
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.030 align:start position:0%
so how is this going to be affected
by<00:02:56.000><c> vaccines</c><00:02:57.040><c> well</c><00:02:57.360><c> you</c><00:02:57.519><c> see</c><00:02:57.760><c> tom</c>

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
by vaccines well you see tom
 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.790 align:start position:0%
by vaccines well you see tom
just<00:02:59.200><c> by</c><00:02:59.440><c> looking</c><00:02:59.680><c> at</c><00:02:59.840><c> this</c><00:03:00.080><c> definition</c><00:03:00.640><c> of</c>

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
the r number you can see that there are
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.149 align:start position:0%
the r number you can see that there are

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
three ways in which the r can be reduced
 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.589 align:start position:0%
three ways in which the r can be reduced
right<00:03:06.400><c> so</c><00:03:06.560><c> that</c><00:03:06.800><c> because</c><00:03:07.040><c> there</c><00:03:07.120><c> are</c><00:03:07.280><c> three</c>

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
right so that because there are three
 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.430 align:start position:0%
right so that because there are three

for
 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.589 align:start position:0%

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
so the longer someone is sick then the
 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.589 align:start position:0%
so the longer someone is sick then the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%

nobody<00:05:06.479><c> has</c><00:05:06.639><c> immunity</c><00:05:07.360><c> so</c><00:05:07.600><c> s</c><00:05:07.840><c> naught</c><00:05:08.080><c> would</c><00:05:08.240><c> be</c>

nobody has immunity so s naught would be
 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:09.590 align:start position:0%
nobody has immunity so s naught would be

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.270 align:start position:0%
one
yes<00:05:09.919><c> so</c><00:05:10.080><c> that</c><00:05:10.160><c> means</c><00:05:10.400><c> everyone's</c><00:05:10.720><c> susceptible</c>

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes so that means everyone's susceptible
 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.110 align:start position:0%
yes so that means everyone's susceptible
right<00:05:11.440><c> anyone</c><00:05:11.759><c> in</c><00:05:11.840><c> the</c><00:05:11.919><c> population</c>

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
right anyone in the population
 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.029 align:start position:0%
right anyone in the population
could<00:05:13.280><c> possibly</c><00:05:13.600><c> catch</c><00:05:13.840><c> this</c><00:05:14.080><c> exactly</c><00:05:14.639><c> gotcha</c>

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
could possibly catch this exactly gotcha
 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.270 align:start position:0%
could possibly catch this exactly gotcha
and<00:05:15.120><c> so</c><00:05:15.759><c> so</c><00:05:15.919><c> if</c><00:05:16.000><c> we</c><00:05:16.160><c> just</c><00:05:16.320><c> write</c><00:05:16.479><c> that</c><00:05:16.720><c> as</c><00:05:16.800><c> one</c>

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so so if we just write that as one
 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.150 align:start position:0%
and so so if we just write that as one
so<00:05:17.520><c> r</c><00:05:17.680><c> over</c><00:05:18.000><c> a</c><00:05:18.639><c> and</c><00:05:18.800><c> this</c><00:05:18.960><c> was</c><00:05:19.360><c> approximated</c><00:05:20.000><c> to</c>

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
so r over a and this was approximated to
 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.629 align:start position:0%
so r over a and this was approximated to
be

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
be
 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.550 align:start position:0%
be
maybe<00:05:20.880><c> about</c><00:05:21.199><c> three</c><00:05:21.840><c> yeah</c><00:05:22.080><c> at</c><00:05:22.240><c> the</c><00:05:22.320><c> start</c><00:05:22.479><c> of</c>

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
maybe about three yeah at the start of
 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.150 align:start position:0%
maybe about three yeah at the start of
the<00:05:22.720><c> pandemic</c><00:05:23.199><c> so</c><00:05:23.680><c> about</c>

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
the pandemic so about
 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.749 align:start position:0%
the pandemic so about
three<00:05:24.639><c> so</c><00:05:24.800><c> if</c><00:05:24.960><c> we</c><00:05:25.039><c> want</c><00:05:25.199><c> to</c><00:05:25.280><c> get</c><00:05:25.440><c> back</c><00:05:25.600><c> to</c>

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
three so if we want to get back to
 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.070 align:start position:0%
three so if we want to get back to
normal<00:05:26.080><c> life</c><00:05:26.400><c> we</c><00:05:26.479><c> can</c><00:05:26.639><c> sort</c><00:05:26.800><c> of</c><00:05:26.880><c> plug</c><00:05:27.199><c> this</c><00:05:27.360><c> in</c>

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
normal life we can sort of plug this in
 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.230 align:start position:0%
normal life we can sort of plug this in
to<00:05:28.240><c> this</c><00:05:28.639><c> equation</c><00:05:29.199><c> here</c><00:05:30.000><c> right</c><00:05:30.400><c> so</c><00:05:30.880><c> we</c><00:05:31.039><c> want</c>

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
to this equation here right so we want
 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.749 align:start position:0%
to this equation here right so we want
uh<00:05:33.280><c> r</c><00:05:33.680><c> over</c><00:05:34.000><c> s</c>

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.189 align:start position:0%
uh r over s
s<00:05:36.160><c> star</c><00:05:36.880><c> let's</c><00:05:37.120><c> say</c><00:05:37.600><c> which</c><00:05:37.919><c> is</c><00:05:38.320><c> the</c><00:05:38.479><c> number</c><00:05:38.720><c> of</c>

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
s star let's say which is the number of
 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.110 align:start position:0%
s star let's say which is the number of
people<00:05:39.520><c> who</c><00:05:39.680><c> are</c><00:05:39.919><c> still</c><00:05:40.160><c> susceptible</c><00:05:40.800><c> after</c>

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
people who are still susceptible after
 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.230 align:start position:0%
people who are still susceptible after
vaccination

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.590 align:start position:0%
vaccination
yeah<00:05:43.039><c> so</c><00:05:43.280><c> r</c><00:05:43.759><c> s</c><00:05:43.919><c> star</c><00:05:44.320><c> over</c><00:05:44.639><c> a</c><00:05:45.120><c> is</c>

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so r s star over a is
 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.710 align:start position:0%
yeah so r s star over a is
less<00:05:45.840><c> than</c><00:05:46.080><c> one</c><00:05:46.639><c> like</c><00:05:46.880><c> that</c><00:05:47.919><c> and</c><00:05:48.080><c> then</c>

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
less than one like that and then
 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.790 align:start position:0%
less than one like that and then
we<00:05:48.880><c> do</c><00:05:50.000><c> simple</c><00:05:50.320><c> rearranging</c><00:05:51.600><c> less</c><00:05:51.840><c> than</c>

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
we do simple rearranging less than
 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.309 align:start position:0%
we do simple rearranging less than
a<00:05:53.039><c> over</c><00:05:53.360><c> r</c><00:05:53.680><c> which</c><00:05:53.919><c> is</c><00:05:54.080><c> less</c><00:05:54.320><c> than</c>

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
a over r which is less than
 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.670 align:start position:0%
a over r which is less than
one-third<00:05:57.840><c> which</c><00:05:58.080><c> means</c><00:05:58.720><c> so</c><00:05:59.199><c> one-third</c><00:05:59.600><c> of</c>

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
one-third which means so one-third of
 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.590 align:start position:0%
one-third which means so one-third of
the<00:05:59.759><c> people</c><00:06:00.000><c> would</c><00:06:00.240><c> still</c><00:06:00.560><c> be</c><00:06:00.800><c> susceptible</c>

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
the people would still be susceptible
 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.350 align:start position:0%
the people would still be susceptible
after<00:06:01.919><c> vaccination</c><00:06:02.560><c> yeah</c><00:06:02.800><c> which</c><00:06:03.039><c> means</c><00:06:03.280><c> we</c>

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
after vaccination yeah which means we
 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.629 align:start position:0%
after vaccination yeah which means we
need<00:06:03.520><c> to</c><00:06:03.680><c> vaccinate</c>

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
need to vaccinate
 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.510 align:start position:0%
need to vaccinate
two-thirds<00:06:05.120><c> of</c><00:06:05.199><c> the</c><00:06:05.280><c> population</c><00:06:06.400><c> so</c><00:06:06.639><c> the</c><00:06:07.120><c> the</c>

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.469 align:start position:0%

people who are uh still susceptible
 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.990 align:start position:0%
people who are uh still susceptible
after

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
after
 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.230 align:start position:0%
after
your<00:06:46.160><c> vaccination</c><00:06:46.720><c> program</c><00:06:47.600><c> plus</c><00:06:47.919><c> the</c><00:06:48.080><c> people</c>

who are vaccinated would be
 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.950 align:start position:0%
who are vaccinated would be
one<00:06:51.199><c> yeah</c><00:06:51.440><c> so</c><00:06:51.599><c> you're</c><00:06:51.840><c> either</c><00:06:52.240><c> vaccinated</c><00:06:52.880><c> or</c>

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
one yeah so you're either vaccinated or
 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.670 align:start position:0%
one yeah so you're either vaccinated or
you're<00:06:53.199><c> not</c>

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
you're not
 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.790 align:start position:0%
you're not
exactly<00:06:54.319><c> yeah</c><00:06:54.639><c> yeah</c><00:06:55.120><c> and</c><00:06:55.280><c> then</c><00:06:56.080><c> so</c><00:06:56.560><c> we</c><00:06:56.639><c> can</c>

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah yeah and then so we can
 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.909 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah yeah and then so we can
rearrange<00:06:57.280><c> this</c>

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
rearrange this

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%

epidemic
 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.990 align:start position:0%
epidemic
so<00:07:19.919><c> that's</c><00:07:20.240><c> exactly</c><00:07:20.639><c> where</c><00:07:21.280><c> the</c><00:07:21.440><c> two</c><00:07:21.680><c> thirds</c>

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
so that's exactly where the two thirds
 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.029 align:start position:0%
so that's exactly where the two thirds
came<00:07:22.160><c> from</c><00:07:22.319><c> then</c><00:07:22.560><c> isn't</c><00:07:22.800><c> it</c>

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
came from then isn't it
 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:24.469 align:start position:0%
came from then isn't it
in<00:07:23.199><c> the</c><00:07:23.280><c> expression</c><00:07:23.680><c> you</c><00:07:23.759><c> had</c><00:07:23.919><c> here</c><00:07:24.160><c> so</c><00:07:24.240><c> when</c>

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
in the expression you had here so when
 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.230 align:start position:0%
in the expression you had here so when

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
arnold was three
 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.270 align:start position:0%
arnold was three
we<00:07:26.400><c> needed</c><00:07:26.720><c> s</c><00:07:26.960><c> star</c><00:07:27.759><c> less</c><00:07:28.000><c> than</c><00:07:28.160><c> one</c><00:07:28.319><c> third</c><00:07:28.960><c> so</c>

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
we needed s star less than one third so
 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.230 align:start position:0%
we needed s star less than one third so
that<00:07:29.440><c> means</c>

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
that means
 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.990 align:start position:0%
that means

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.270 align:start position:0%

i.e<00:07:34.720><c> we</c><00:07:34.960><c> vaccinated</c><00:07:36.319><c> more</c><00:07:36.639><c> than</c>

i.e we vaccinated more than

i.e we vaccinated more than

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%

r naught is four
 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.390 align:start position:0%

then<00:07:49.120><c> you</c><00:07:49.360><c> would</c><00:07:49.440><c> have</c><00:07:49.599><c> to</c><00:07:49.759><c> vaccinate</c><00:07:50.240><c> at</c>

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
then you would have to vaccinate at
 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
then you would have to vaccinate at

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
yes exactly so what happens
 

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.029 align:start position:0%
yes exactly so what happens
if<00:08:12.319><c> the</c><00:08:12.479><c> vaccine</c><00:08:13.120><c> isn't</c><00:08:13.680><c> 100</c><00:08:14.400><c> effective</c><00:08:14.879><c> how</c>

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
if the vaccine isn't 100 effective how
 

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
if the vaccine isn't 100 effective how
is<00:08:15.199><c> that</c><00:08:15.440><c> going</c><00:08:15.680><c> to</c><00:08:15.840><c> modify</c>

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
is that going to modify
 

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:20.230 align:start position:0%
is that going to modify
our<00:08:18.080><c> number</c><00:08:18.400><c> of</c><00:08:18.560><c> vaccinations</c><00:08:19.280><c> required</c>

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
our number of vaccinations required
 

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.110 align:start position:0%
our number of vaccinations required
right<00:08:20.479><c> so</c><00:08:20.639><c> this</c><00:08:20.879><c> changes</c><00:08:21.280><c> the</c><00:08:22.319><c> the</c><00:08:22.720><c> equation</c>

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
right so this changes the the equation
 

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.790 align:start position:0%
right so this changes the the equation
the<00:08:23.280><c> inequality</c><00:08:24.000><c> slightly</c>

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
the inequality slightly
 

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.749 align:start position:0%
the inequality slightly
so<00:08:25.120><c> actually</c><00:08:26.000><c> this</c><00:08:26.800><c> kind</c><00:08:27.120><c> of</c><00:08:27.199><c> sort</c><00:08:27.360><c> of</c><00:08:27.520><c> stays</c>

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
so actually this kind of sort of stays
 

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:28.309 align:start position:0%
so actually this kind of sort of stays

over r naught yeah but then how do you
get<00:08:42.479><c> this</c>

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
get this
 

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:46.310 align:start position:0%
get this

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.949 align:start position:0%

vaccinated

00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:01.110 align:start position:0%

and<00:08:59.120><c> then</c><00:08:59.519><c> and</c><00:08:59.680><c> you</c><00:08:59.839><c> had</c><00:08:59.920><c> a</c><00:09:00.000><c> 95</c><00:09:00.720><c> effective</c>

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then and you had a 95 effective
 

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.389 align:start position:0%
and then and you had a 95 effective
vaccine<00:09:01.839><c> then</c>

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine then
 

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:06.150 align:start position:0%
vaccine then
95<00:09:03.519><c> of</c><00:09:03.600><c> those</c><00:09:03.839><c> 100</c><00:09:04.480><c> would</c><00:09:04.640><c> be</c><00:09:05.360><c> vaccinated</c>

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
95 of those 100 would be vaccinated
 

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.230 align:start position:0%
95 of those 100 would be vaccinated
effectively<00:09:07.760><c> and</c><00:09:07.920><c> so</c><00:09:08.160><c> e</c><00:09:08.399><c> there</c><00:09:08.560><c> would</c><00:09:08.720><c> be</c><00:09:09.000><c> 0.95</c>

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.230 align:start position:0%
effectively and so e there would be 0.95
exactly<00:09:10.720><c> it's</c><00:09:10.880><c> a</c><00:09:11.040><c> number</c><00:09:11.279><c> between</c><00:09:11.760><c> zero</c><00:09:12.080><c> and</c>

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
exactly it's a number between zero and
 

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.150 align:start position:0%
exactly it's a number between zero and

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.990 align:start position:0%

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:21.750 align:start position:0%

and<00:09:17.680><c> then</c><00:09:18.080><c> 0.95</c><00:09:19.040><c> would</c><00:09:19.200><c> represent</c><00:09:19.600><c> 95</c>

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then 0.95 would represent 95
 

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.230 align:start position:0%
and then 0.95 would represent 95
exactly<00:09:22.480><c> yeah</c><00:09:23.279><c> and</c><00:09:23.360><c> then</c><00:09:23.519><c> we</c><00:09:23.680><c> can</c><00:09:23.839><c> rearrange</c>

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%

right<00:09:40.399><c> so</c><00:09:41.200><c> let's</c><00:09:41.440><c> say</c><00:09:41.920><c> that</c><00:09:42.320><c> uh</c><00:09:42.720><c> r</c><00:09:42.880><c> naught</c><00:09:43.200><c> was</c>

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
right so let's say that uh r naught was
 

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.110 align:start position:0%
right so let's say that uh r naught was

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.470 align:start position:0%
three right so for 100 effective vaccine
we<00:09:47.279><c> need</c><00:09:47.360><c> to</c><00:09:47.440><c> vaccinate</c><00:09:47.920><c> two</c><00:09:48.080><c> thirds</c><00:09:48.320><c> of</c><00:09:48.399><c> the</c>

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%

00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
say we took
 

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.990 align:start position:0%
say we took
one<00:09:57.440><c> that</c><00:09:57.680><c> is</c><00:09:57.839><c> 95</c><00:09:58.640><c> effective</c><00:09:59.360><c> yeah</c><00:09:59.680><c> right</c><00:09:59.839><c> so</c>

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
one that is 95 effective yeah right so
 

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.630 align:start position:0%
one that is 95 effective yeah right so
you<00:10:00.160><c> plug</c><00:10:00.399><c> in</c>

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
you plug in
 

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.829 align:start position:0%
you plug in
0.95<00:10:01.440><c> here</c><00:10:02.320><c> and</c><00:10:02.399><c> that</c><00:10:02.640><c> would</c><00:10:02.800><c> mean</c><00:10:03.120><c> that</c><00:10:03.600><c> we</c>

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
0.95 here and that would mean that we
 

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:04.710 align:start position:0%
0.95 here and that would mean that we
vaccinate

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinate
 

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.430 align:start position:0%
vaccinate
70<00:10:05.519><c> of</c><00:10:05.600><c> the</c><00:10:05.760><c> population</c><00:10:06.320><c> okay</c><00:10:06.800><c> so</c><00:10:06.959><c> that's</c><00:10:07.200><c> just</c>

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
70 of the population okay so that's just
 

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.350 align:start position:0%
70 of the population okay so that's just
a<00:10:07.519><c> little</c><00:10:07.680><c> bit</c><00:10:07.920><c> more</c><00:10:08.160><c> than</c><00:10:08.399><c> 67</c>

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit more than 67
 

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.150 align:start position:0%
a little bit more than 67
and<00:10:09.680><c> it's</c><00:10:09.760><c> quite</c><00:10:10.000><c> doable</c><00:10:10.640><c> yeah</c><00:10:10.880><c> um</c><00:10:11.600><c> but</c><00:10:11.760><c> if</c><00:10:12.000><c> we</c>

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
and it's quite doable yeah um but if we
 

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
and it's quite doable yeah um but if we
took

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
took
 

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.150 align:start position:0%
took
another<00:10:12.880><c> vaccine</c><00:10:13.279><c> that</c><00:10:13.440><c> was</c><00:10:13.600><c> maybe</c><00:10:13.920><c> less</c>

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
another vaccine that was maybe less
 

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.310 align:start position:0%
another vaccine that was maybe less
effective<00:10:14.959><c> 79</c>

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
effective 79
 

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.190 align:start position:0%
effective 79
so<00:10:16.480><c> you</c><00:10:16.640><c> plug</c><00:10:16.880><c> in</c><00:10:17.040><c> 0.79</c><00:10:18.000><c> here</c><00:10:18.640><c> then</c><00:10:18.800><c> you</c><00:10:19.040><c> need</c>

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
so you plug in 0.79 here then you need
 

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.990 align:start position:0%
so you plug in 0.79 here then you need
to<00:10:19.360><c> vaccinate</c>

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
to vaccinate
 

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.230 align:start position:0%
to vaccinate
about<00:10:20.240><c> 80</c><00:10:20.800><c> of</c><00:10:20.959><c> the</c><00:10:21.040><c> population</c><00:10:21.760><c> it's</c><00:10:21.920><c> nice</c><00:10:22.160><c> to</c>

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
about 80 of the population it's nice to
 

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.829 align:start position:0%
about 80 of the population it's nice to

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
have the exact numbers but i think the
 

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
have the exact numbers but i think the
