1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.367
hello everyone it's me in my sweatpants

2
00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:06.615
wearing my fuzzy socks

3
00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:07.743
because i have one day left until i

4
00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:10.107
start my internship

5
00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:12.124
and i can just not be expected to put on

6
00:00:10.107 --> 00:00:14.139
normal clothes that you play on the

7
00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:17.175
street right now

8
00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.193
so yeah sorry not sorry but today we're

9
00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:23.230
going to do an unboxing of this

10
00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:26.261
massive package because a few weeks ago

11
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.271
microsoft reached out to me yes you

12
00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:30.306
heard that right

13
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:33.338
microsoft reached out to mwah um

14
00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:36.362
i could not believe it either but

15
00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:37.373
they said that they have a device that

16
00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:39.395
could replace

17
00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:41.417
the free devices which i currently use

18
00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:44.446
because i currently use a macbook pro

19
00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:46.461
a macbook and an ipad pro and i need all

20
00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:47.477
three of them because all three of them

21
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:49.498
do different things and

22
00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:51.513
there's not one apple device that does

23
00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:53.533
all of it for me

24
00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:55.550
um so they said they have something that

25
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:58.584
could do that and i said

26
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.593
okay show me and so they sent me this

27
00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:01.615
this is a gift

28
00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:02.625
um but i am not sponsored to say

29
00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:04.646
anything positive

30
00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:06.666
and today we're just gonna unbox it take

31
00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:09.696
a look at what they actually sent me

32
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:11.711
and yeah let's do it okay so i already

33
00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:13.729
had to open these parts of the box

34
00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:16.765
because i have to hide my address

35
00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.765
um but yeah let's go

36
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:24.848
oh wow there's like wood

37
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:26.863
like i don't know how to put it wait

38
00:01:24.848 --> 00:01:30.899
oh my god i think this is like a wooden

39
00:01:26.863 --> 00:01:32.922
box okay so here we go

40
00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.930
there is this sort of box like thing

41
00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:34.942
because

42
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.966
when you take out the plastic you can

43
00:01:34.942 --> 00:01:40.100
see the it's a real box

44
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:43.103
um so i'm just gonna have to figure out

45
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.104
how oh oh okay it opens like this

46
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.106
so we do have to take it out in order to

47
00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:49.109
open it

48
00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:50.110
damn it's so heavy okay let me get this

49
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.111
out of the box then then i'll get back

50
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.113
to you

51
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:55.115
okay so we made it we have the box um i

52
00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:57.117
gotta say this box has like really

53
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.118
like quite thick wood so like it's quite

54
00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.121
heavy

55
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:02.122
like you can store stuff in here and

56
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.125
it's gonna stay safe

57
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:09.128
um so this is what it looks like um so

58
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:13.133
yeah let's open it up

59
00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:15.135
this is so fancy um this is so cool like

60
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:17.137
it literally has like my name printed on

61
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.137
it i don't know if you guys can see this

62
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.139
well

63
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:22.142
and then it also has the microsoft thing

64
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:24.144
on it um so i now have proof

65
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:27.147
that i once got a gift from microsoft

66
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:29.149
which is still so insane to me to say

67
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:32.152
um but yeah let's take a look at what is

68
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:35.154
actually in here

69
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:36.156
um i'm guessing we open it up like this

70
00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:39.159
we're gonna

71
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:40.160
take a look at this first and then we're

72
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.162
gonna take a look at this

73
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.163
i can already show you guys this what it

74
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.164
looks like

75
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:47.167
we're gonna take a look at that in a

76
00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:47.167
moment

77
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:55.175
oh i did not realize it has the

78
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:56.175
microsoft logo in the wood um that's

79
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:59.179
cute

80
00:02:56.175 --> 00:03:00.180
wow this is the most fancy gift i have

81
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:04.183
ever gotten

82
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.188
from any brand um so thank you

83
00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:08.188
okay so this is how we open it

84
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:19.199
hello we're gonna have a satisfying

85
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:19.199
moment

86
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.208
oh it's stuck that was not so satisfying

87
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:32.212
there we go now let's go

88
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:34.214
oh wow hi

89
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:36.216
um so this is the microsoft surface book

90
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:39.219
free so that would be

91
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:41.221
this one right here um

92
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.223
looks pretty cool i think it looks

93
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:47.227
pretty you know very modern

94
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:48.228
um very different than my um pink

95
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:52.232
macbook

96
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:55.235
admittedly um but i like it

97
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:57.237
it's it's different but cool like i can

98
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.239
see myself like at uni with this

99
00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.240
maybe with some cool peppy stickers on

100
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.244
here

101
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.246
um i have plans for this um i'm hoping

102
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:08.247
it's also you know just

103
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:10.249
gonna do a job of free devices which

104
00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:12.252
would be amazing

105
00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.253
it is a little heavier than my small

106
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:17.256
macbook

107
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:19.259
but i believe you can actually take off

108
00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:20.260
the screen basically i'm making this

109
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.263
sound very weird

110
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.265
um the idea is you take up a screen and

111
00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.266
you can use it like a tablet

112
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:29.268
so you don't always have to use it as a

113
00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:31.271
laptop um

114
00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:32.272
so i'm gonna figure out how to do that

115
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:36.275
in just a second

116
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:38.277
but this is so cool

117
00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:39.278
oh my god and it has a very satisfying

118
00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:42.282
click

119
00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:43.282
i like that so yeah that's what it looks

120
00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:46.286
like

121
00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:48.288
and let's explore the rest in this

122
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:51.290
massive wooden box and then we're gonna

123
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:54.294
get back to this one

124
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.295
okay so we also got a cup which is so

125
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:59.298
cute because it has an e

126
00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:59.299
on it and um well my name is elena so

127
00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:02.301

128
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.302

129
00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:05.305

130
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:08.307
which is cute breakfast blend also like

131
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:10.310

147
00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:50.350

i will never throw this box away like

153
00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:00.360
ever

154
00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:01.361
like you don't just get like a microsoft

155
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.364
box

156
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:08.367
out of freaking wood to throw it away um

157
00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:09.369
but there's something under this um so i

158
00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:13.372
don't know if this is just paper

159
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:18.377
um but let's take a look oh wow

160
00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:21.380
oh my god we we got more gifts

161
00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:22.382
okay um there's a little bit of

162
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.384
instructions of what to do first

163
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:26.386
that's good because like the last time i

164
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:31.390
owned a microsoft device

165
00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:36.395
was in about like 2010 um so

166
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:39.398
i need help um but whoa we

167
00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:42.402
we got more gifts

168
00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:42.402
oh my gosh okay um

169
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:47.406
first of all headphones the microsoft

170
00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.409
surface

171
00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:50.410
headphones too okay the most important

172
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.410
thing has been settled about these

173
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.413
headphones

174
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.414
they are noise cancelling and that's

175
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:57.416
what i care about because

176
00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:59.418
i'm an introvert who likes to block out

177
00:06:57.416 --> 00:07:02.421
society and occasionally

178
00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:04.423
isolate herself from mankind so

179
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:06.425
that's good they are also compatible

180
00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.426
with the iphone which is important

181
00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:08.428
because

182
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.429
in my day-to-day life i only use apple

183
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:12.431
devices

184
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.432
so i can still use this with my phone

185
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:15.435
which is great

186
00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:16.435
um but yeah i'm excited to try them out

187
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.439
i was like

188
00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:22.441
the color is just perfectly fitting the

189
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.442
um surface book that they gifted to me

190
00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:25.445
which is

191
00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:26.446
it's just cool you know i'm gonna roll

192
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.447
up a university

193
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:30.449
and i'm just gonna have everything

194
00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:32.452
perfectly color-coded like

195
00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:33.452
you wait for it okay and then we also

196
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:37.457
got

197
00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:40.459
a pen um for um our surface book

198
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:42.461
because as i said you can take up a

199
00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:44.463
screen i got this right

200
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:46.465
and i'm always very not confident when i

201
00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:49.468
talk about tech because

202
00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:51.470
i don't know enough about it to you know

203
00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:53.472
be an expert and i know on youtube there

204
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.474
are a lot of tech youtubers

205
00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:56.476
so i'm not coming for your brand because

206
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:59.478
i honestly couldn't i don't have the

207
00:07:56.476 --> 00:08:01.480
knowledge to i'm just here being happy

208
00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:02.481
that i've got an incredibly great gift

209
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.483
um so

210
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:06.486
give me my moment but don't expect tech

211
00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:06.486
expertise from me

212
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:14.494
i can't even open this um

213
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.496
as i said i don't have expertise in tech

214
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:19.499
oh there's a sticker i'm hiding the

215
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:22.502
entire mess behind this box

216
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:24.504
but it's a mess um and i threw all the

217
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:27.506
plastic and stuff on the floor and it's

218
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:28.508
it's just not looking good um but that's

219
00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:31.510
okay because

220
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:32.512
i got gifts and that's so cool and it's

221
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:36.516
not even my birthday

222
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:39.518
so hey um that's what the pen looks like

223
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:40.519
we're gonna give it a try um and see how

224
00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:42.522
it works

225
00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:44.524
what i did hear however is that they

226
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:48.527
actually have an eraser on top

227
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:51.531
um because i do use an apple pencil

228
00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:53.532
um on my ipad pro and

229
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.534
it doesn't have an eraser on top and i

230
00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:56.535
just think that's such a cool idea

231
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.536
because that's what you normally have

232
00:08:56.535 --> 00:09:00.539
when you use

233
00:08:57.536 --> 00:09:03.542
a normal pencil um so that's

234
00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:05.544
pretty cool in my opinion but yeah and

235
00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:08.547
then the last thing we have

236
00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:08.548
oh my god i did see this um on their

237
00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:10.550
website

238
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.551
i know what this is but i don't think i

239
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.553
would know what it is if i hadn't seen

240
00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:18.557
it before because it just looks

241
00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:21.561
very weird um it's a mouse

242
00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:24.564
um but a very different mouse

243
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:25.564
pretty cool but like very random as well

244
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:28.567
as a mouse

245
00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:29.569
oh my god these are so many gifts like

246
00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:31.570
this is more than i get for my birthday

247
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.572
okay and christmas

248
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.574
and pretty much throughout the year um

249
00:09:33.572 --> 00:09:38.577
so thank you

250
00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:40.580
that's insane um i'm um

251
00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:43.582
now first of all gonna find a place for

252
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:47.586
this amazing wooden box because

253
00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:49.589
um it's mine and i shall cherish it

254
00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:52.591
this is actually a really cool box like

255
00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:55.594
this is such a treasure trove you know

256
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:59.598
like that's a flex i have my wooden box

257
00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:59.598
with all my important things

258
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:03.603
okay i'm gonna stop talking about the

259
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.604
box um and we're gonna get to the

260
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:07.607
important part

261
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:08.608
which is the surface book so let's take

262
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.609
a look

263
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:12.611
several days later so it's been a few

264
00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:13.613
days since i did the unboxing and i just

265
00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:15.615
want to take some time so that i can

266
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.616
tell you about my initial experience

267
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:19.618
with the product

268
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:20.620
so yeah let's take a look at them and

269
00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:22.621
let me tell you a little bit what i

270
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.623
think about them so far

271
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:25.624
first up is the microsoft surface book

272
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:27.626
free you guys already know what it looks

273
00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:28.627
like but as you can see i also attached

274
00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:30.629
my pen to it

275
00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:32.632
because there is a quite strong magnet

276
00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:34.634
on the tablet slash screen side of it

277
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:36.636
and you can just permanently store your

278
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.636
pen there it won't fall off if you put

279
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.638
it in your bag

280
00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:40.639
and that's just super useful when you're

281
00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:42.642
on the go especially

282
00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:44.643
as a student now the other thing that

283
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:46.646
makes working with this device

284
00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:49.648
just a little more convenient is that it

285
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:50.649
has something like face id on the iphone

286
00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:52.651
and ipad

287
00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:54.653
so basically you just open up your

288
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:56.655
device whenever you want to work with it

289
00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:57.657
and you don't have to put in your pin

290
00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:59.658
but instead you just take a look at the

291
00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:01.660
lock screen

292
00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:02.662
and you've unlocked your computer that

293
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.664
just makes it quicker to work with it i

294
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:06.665
found that to be like my favorite way of

295
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:09.669
unlocking it i don't think i've ever

296
00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:11.671
put in my pin for this device so far

297
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:13.672
so it works really well with recognizing

298
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.673
your face you just have to sit in front

299
00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:16.675
of it for

300
00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:18.678
like a minute to set it up and then you

301
00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:21.680
can always use it i was also right about

302
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:23.682
being able to detach the screen so you

303
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.684
just press this button right here

304
00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:27.687
which is the button for just taking off

305
00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:28.687
the screen and then the screen becomes a

306
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.689
little

307
00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:31.690
loose and you can just take it off and

308
00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:34.693
there you go now

309
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.694
as a tablet this thing also works quite

310
00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:37.696
well

311
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:38.698
it is in my opinion a fully functioning

312
00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:39.698
tablet but also a fully functioning

313
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:42.701
laptop

314
00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:43.702
so it is really the best of both worlds

315
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:46.706
the tablet is

316
00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:49.709
super super lightweight it is less heavy

317
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:51.710
than my ipad pro from 2017

318
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:53.712
which really surprised me because it is

319
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.715
bigger but yeah

320
00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:56.716
i enjoy it so far i'm not the best

321
00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:59.719
friend

322
00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:00.720
of microsoft onenote yet i'm gonna see i

323
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.721
think i need to play around with the

324
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.724
settings a little bit

325
00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:06.725
to customize it and you know just make

326
00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.726
it a format that i like because i'm not

327
00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:09.728
a big fan

328
00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:10.729
of notes that can go off into nirvana

329
00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:12.731
because

330
00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:13.733
there so far i don't have a page but

331
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:15.735
rather just something you know that you

332
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:17.737
can keep writing on and on

333
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:20.739
and the document will just get bigger

334
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:22.741
for you but there are no page limits and

335
00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:24.743
that's something that i personally don't

336
00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:26.745
like um so i'm going to see

337
00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:27.747
how to change it customize it or maybe

338
00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:29.749
if there's a different note-taking app

339
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:32.751
that i like better on the surface

340
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:33.752
but other than that so far i can say the

341
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:35.754
screen quality is

342
00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:36.756
amazing quality of pictures on the

343
00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:39.758
screen is great

344
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:40.759
and the screen is very good at

345
00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:42.761
recognizing the pen

346
00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:43.762
and also it has great palm rejection so

347
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:45.764
that you know

348
00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:47.766
when you rest your palm on it while

349
00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:50.769
writing it won't think that that's also

350
00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:50.769
something that you wanted to write um so

351
00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:52.771
so far

352
00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:53.773
really no complaints about the screen

353
00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:56.775
the only thing that i just think

354
00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:58.777
will take some getting used to is the

355
00:12:56.775 --> 00:13:00.779
new system because it's different

356
00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:02.781
than the mac system and i've had

357
00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:04.783
macbooks for

358
00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:06.785
a long time so i haven't really used a

359
00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:08.787
microsoft device in a while

360
00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:09.788
um but you can find your way around this

361
00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:11.790
as an apple user

362
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:13.792
you kind of know where the important

363
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.794
things are but i think you know for

364
00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:16.796
getting into the settings that you like

365
00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:17.797
and just you know figuring out how to

366
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:19.798
use everything

367
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:21.800
finding the best apps i think that will

368
00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:24.803
take a little bit of time

369
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.804
but so far i like it and i'm excited to

370
00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:26.806
use it

371
00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:29.808
now this thing over here isn't just a

372
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:30.809
keyboard it is also some extra battery

373
00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:31.811
life for your tablet

374
00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:34.813
so you can charge these two together if

375
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:36.815
you want and this one has

376
00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:37.816
another few hours of battery life for

377
00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:39.818
your tablet

378
00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:40.819
so if you're running low you just put it

379
00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:41.820
back into a keyboard and you can keep

380
00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:44.823
using it

381
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.825
and actually i would recommend putting

382
00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:48.827
it onto the keyboard even when you

383
00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:49.828
want to take notes with your pen and

384
00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:52.831
here's why because

385
00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:52.831
this has a drawing position with the

386
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:54.834
keyboard

387
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:56.836
because you can also attach it the other

388
00:13:54.834 --> 00:14:00.840
way around to the keyboard

389
00:13:56.836 --> 00:14:04.843
basically you just put it on like this

390
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.844
and then you fold it and the cool thing

391
00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:07.846
is now

392
00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:09.848
you have an angled position and that's

393
00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:12.851
actually better for writing than

394
00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:15.854
writing on a straight flat surface

395
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:16.855
so this is actually more ergonomical so

396
00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.857
i would recommend

397
00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:19.858
using this when you're taking notes in a

398
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:21.860
lecture and i think it's just great that

399
00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:23.862
they thought of this because

400
00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.864
it means that you can keep your tablet

401
00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:26.865
with a higher battery life while you're

402
00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:28.867
taking notes

403
00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:30.869
even when you don't want to use the

404
00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:31.870
keyboard next up we have probably my

405
00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:34.873
favorite thing which is

406
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.874
the mouse i just think it's so cool

407
00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:37.876
because you can do this

408
00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:38.877
and i can just see myself doing this all

409
00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:42.881
the time

410
00:14:38.877 --> 00:14:44.883
out of boredom um it's fun okay

411
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:46.885
now it is a mouse it does the job it has

412
00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:48.887
its clicky thingies here

413
00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:49.889
um i can't tell you yet how comfortable

414
00:14:48.887 --> 00:14:51.890
this mouse is

415
00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:53.892
for using it you know when you're

416
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.894
editing and stuff

417
00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:56.895
so i will tell you about that in my long

418
00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:59.898
term review

419
00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:59.898
for now all i can say is the material is

420
00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:02.901
super

421
00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:02.901
soft and it's just really nice to touch

422
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:04.903
um

423
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:06.905
and it's just a really cool mouse

424
00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:08.907
because i don't think anybody expects a

425
00:15:06.905 --> 00:15:10.909
mouse to look like this

426
00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:12.911
and i guess it's easy to transport

427
00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:13.912
because it's very thin

428
00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:15.914
but yeah that's really all i can say

429
00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:17.916
about the mouse for now but i will give

430
00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:19.918
you more details in my long term review

431
00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:21.920
and lastly we have the headphones now

432
00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:23.922
the headphones have already become a

433
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.924
part of my life i use them quite a bit

434
00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:27.926
and i love them i think they're amazing

435
00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:28.927
they have really great noise

436
00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:30.929
cancellation

437
00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:32.931
which is what an introverted person like

438
00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:34.933
me really cares about

439
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:35.934
and i love their design because you can

440
00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:38.937
turn on

441
00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:39.938
both of these sides here to adjust both

442
00:15:38.937 --> 00:15:42.941
the noise cancelling level

443
00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:43.942
but also how loud the sound is playing

444
00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:45.944
and that's just

445
00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:47.946
really useful now you can also click on

446
00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:48.947
them if you want the sound to stop for a

447
00:15:47.946 --> 00:15:49.948
moment

448
00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:51.950
and they also have a recognition for

449
00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:52.951
when you're taking them off

450
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.953
so for example when you want to talk to

451
00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:55.954
someone and you take off your headphones

452
00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:57.956
for a moment

453
00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:58.957
then they will stop playing whatever

454
00:15:57.956 --> 00:16:00.959
they played and when you put them back

455
00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:01.960
on they will go back to playing it

456
00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:03.962
which is really great if you're watching

457
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.964
youtube videos or something because

458
00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:06.965
when you lose a few seconds there

459
00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:08.967
sometimes you don't really know what's

460
00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:11.970
going on anymore um but yeah

461
00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:13.972
these i can only highly recommend um the

462
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.973
material is great it's very soft on the

463
00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:16.975
ear

464
00:16:14.973 --> 00:16:17.976
um it doesn't press your ears to your

465
00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:19.978
head

466
00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:21.980
which is something that like some

467
00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:22.981
headphones are just too harsh for me in

468
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.981
terms of the pressure they put on your

469
00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:25.984
ear

470
00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:26.985
and these are less soft in terms of the

471
00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:29.988
pressure that i put on your ear

472
00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:33.992
than the bose quiet comfort um i

473
00:16:29.988 --> 00:16:34.993
have these as well um but it's not a big

474
00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:36.995
pressure difference

475
00:16:34.993 --> 00:16:37.996
and it's certainly not like when you

476
00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:39.998
take them off of their world that

477
00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:41.100
you would really feel anything of it

478
00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:43.100
it's just something i realized like

479
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.100
after using the two interchangeably

480
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.100
that um there is a bit of a difference

481
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.100
but these are still very very

482
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.100
comfortable to wear

483
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.101
and i think they're very stylish because

484
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:54.101
they're so big let me just show you

485
00:16:51.101 --> 00:16:55.101
um i have a tiny head um but i like this

486
00:16:54.101 --> 00:16:57.101
like this

487
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:59.101
is a look and i think it's a pretty cool

488
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:01.102
look especially because they're color

489
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:02.102
matching all the other things

490
00:17:01.102 --> 00:17:04.102
um i think it will just be a very

491
00:17:02.102 --> 00:17:06.102
aesthetically pleasing look if i use all

492
00:17:04.102 --> 00:17:09.102
of the devices together

493
00:17:06.102 --> 00:17:10.102
um but yeah these i can highly recommend

494
00:17:09.102 --> 00:17:12.103
especially adjusting both the noise

495
00:17:10.102 --> 00:17:15.103
cancellation and

496
00:17:12.103 --> 00:17:17.103
the sound level with these little wheels

497
00:17:15.103 --> 00:17:20.103
means that it's more precise when you're

498
00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:23.104
adjusting it and that's just a big plus

499
00:17:20.103 --> 00:17:23.104
so yeah these headphones are a big yes

500
00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:25.104
for me

501
00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:27.104
and that's it for the quick close-ups

502
00:17:25.104 --> 00:17:29.104
and my first impressions

503
00:17:27.104 --> 00:17:31.105
now i hope you guys enjoyed this video

504
00:17:29.104 --> 00:17:32.105
and i will be doing a long-term review

505
00:17:31.105 --> 00:17:34.105
so

506
00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:36.105
in about like a month or maybe a month

507
00:17:34.105 --> 00:17:38.105
and a half i will get back to you guys

508
00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:39.105
on how these devices have been holding

509
00:17:38.105 --> 00:17:41.106
up and whether i think

510
00:17:39.105 --> 00:17:44.106
that they are good devices to use as

511
00:17:41.106 --> 00:17:46.106
main devices as a university student

512
00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:47.106
yeah thank you so much for watching and

513
00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:49.106
i can't believe

514
00:17:47.106 --> 00:17:50.106
that i got a gift from microsoft but i'm

515
00:17:49.106 --> 00:18:01.108
incredibly grateful

516
00:17:50.106 --> 00:18:01.108
have a nice day bye

517
00:18:02.108 --> 00:18:14.109
[Music]

518
00:18:12.109 --> 00:18:14.109
you
