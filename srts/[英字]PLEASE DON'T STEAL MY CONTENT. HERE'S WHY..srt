00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.356
hello everyone its Alena and I'm back

2
00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:04.485
with another video and today I wanted to

3
00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:07.722
talk to you guys about something rather

4
00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.854
serious because unfortunately it has

5
00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.104
happened to me more than once that

6
00:00:08.854 --> 00:00:12.122
people have been stealing my content so

7
00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:13.139
for those of you who don't know I'm not

8
00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:15.157
just doing YouTube I also write a blog

9
00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.174
and I've actually written this blog for

10
00:00:15.157 --> 00:00:20.200
years before I started at YouTube and

11
00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:22.220
there are share my pictures and I write

12
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.240
a few personal stories about my life or

13
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.258
you know things I like and pretty much

14
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.277
whatever is on my mind and then I also

15
00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:29.296
do YouTube where I share my videos and

16
00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:32.321
then I also have a second channel where

17
00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:33.337
i share videos on law and then i also

18
00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:35.356
have a second website about law and

19
00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:38.379
there are just you know write about my

20
00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:39.398
opinions on some legal topics luckily

21
00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.423
nobody has ever stolen my writing or at

22
00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:43.434
least I don't know about it but I think

23
00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:45.455
that makes sense because it's pretty

24
00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:48.483
personal so I don't think that anybody

25
00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:50.503
would want to steal it but I have had

26
00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:51.517
people steal some of my pictures and it

27
00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:53.536
has also happened to me that somebody

28
00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:54.549
stole a video of mine and that's why I

29
00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:56.568
wanted to talk to you guys about that

30
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.587
today and I also wanted to explain to

31
00:00:56.568 --> 00:01:01.613
people why you really shouldn't be

32
00:00:58.587 --> 00:01:03.634
taking content creators work and using

33
00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:05.653
it without crediting them or just taking

34
00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:08.679
it and straight up uploading it on your

35
00:01:05.653 --> 00:01:09.694
own profile that's absolutely not OK

36
00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.715
and I know it comes in creatives often

37
00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:13.730
say that but in this video I wanted to

38
00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:15.751
show you guys why you're really

39
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.766
disrespecting any content creator if

40
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:18.782
you're stealing their work without

41
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:20.799
crediting them or you're just straight

42
00:01:18.782 --> 00:01:22.826
up taking it and uploading it on your

43
00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.848
own account taking away their ability to

44
00:01:22.826 --> 00:01:26.866
make even a small profit from it on

45
00:01:24.848 --> 00:01:28.882
their own account and I just want to

46
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:31.912
show you guys why that is really

47
00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:32.925
problematic and why it is really not OK

48
00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:34.943
so I'm gonna split this video into two

49
00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:36.960
parts so first I'm going to talk about

50
00:01:34.943 --> 00:01:37.975
pictures that I've had stolen from me

51
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.996
and then I'm gonna talk about the video

52
00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:41.101
so yeah let's get into it

53
00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:43.103
so as I already said I share pictures on

54
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:45.105
my blog but I also share pictures and it

55
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:47.107
for my thumbnails here on YouTube and I

56
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:49.109
also share pictures on my socials so as

57
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:51.111
you guys probably realized whenever you

58
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.113
watch a video of mine at the start there

59
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:55.115
is this little stripe here at the bottom

60
00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:58.118
and it just says socials I have

61
00:01:55.115 --> 00:02:00.120
and what my name on them is and I put

62
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:02.122
these socials out there into the public

63
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.124
and I know that thousands of people who

64
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:06.126
watch my videos can then you know search

65
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.127
me on these socials add me and look at

66
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:10.129
the pictures in the content that I put

67
00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:10.130
out there and that's why these socials

68
00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.134
are social

69
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.135
I keep very very filtered okay I really

70
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:18.137
think about what is the kind of content

71
00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:19.139
that I want to put out there you know

72
00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:22.142
what do I want to share with my audience

73
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:24.144
what do I want out there in the public

74
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:26.146
I don't ever watermark the pictures that

75
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:28.147
I put out there and I don't you know add

76
00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.149
like a little add aleena hand trick in

77
00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:31.151
these pictures because I just think it

78
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:33.153
really destroys the picture I don't

79
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:35.155
think it's pretty I want people to enjoy

80
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:37.157
the pictures as they are and you know

81
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:40.160
very often there is a lot of learning

82
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:42.162
involved in pictures that I make so like

83
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.163
here I want to show you guys just a few

84
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.165
examples of things that I've done on my

85
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:48.167
blog those are pictures you know that

86
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:49.169
take a lot of work they take creative

87
00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:51.171
thinking about what am I going to do

88
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.172
with these pictures and then they take a

89
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.174
lot of work in to you know learning how

90
00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:57.177
to edit them the correct way that they

91
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:59.178
end up looking the way they are and yes

92
00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:00.180
you may just look at this picture for

93
00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:03.182
like ten seconds maybe hit a like button

94
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.184
on Instagram and that's it but as a

95
00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:07.187
content creator sometimes you put hours

96
00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:10.189
of work into a single picture so if

97
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:12.192
someone just takes it and uses it or

98
00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.195
even pretends that it's their own that

99
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:17.196
is really just disrespectful towards the

100
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.198
hours of work that you put into this

101
00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:19.199
picture and I just quickly wanted to

102
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.201
give you guys an example of an Instagram

103
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.203
post that I've recently made just so you

104
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:25.205
guys can understand how much work goes

105
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:27.207
into a single picture that you guys

106
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:29.209
probably look at for 10 seconds but this

107
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:32.212
is how much were content creators put

108
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.214
into it okay so this is the post so for

109
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:36.215
this picture I actually had to think

110
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:38.217
about what kind of picture do I want to

111
00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:40.219
take okay because I took us in my bad

112
00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:42.222
now I'm the only person who works on my

113
00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:45.224
channel and on my socials so I literally

114
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:47.226
take all of my pictures by myself so you

115
00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:49.228
know I had to use a tripod then I had to

116
00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:51.231
use my camera I had to connect my camera

117
00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:54.233
into my phone so that I can then take my

118
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:55.235
picture by myself basically then I had

119
00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:57.237
to go and edit this picture that I had

120
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.238
to think of a caption and then I could

121
00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.240
put it out there and I had to schedule

122
00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:02.242
it to make sure that it comes out at the

123
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.243
right time so let that caption then

124
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.245
would make sense

125
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:08.248
so all in a wall I have probably spent

126
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:11.251
about an hour to two hours on one

127
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:13.253
picture and this is just a picture on my

128
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:15.255
social this is not even a picture where

129
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.257
you know I have to be a lot more precise

130
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:19.259
with the editing because it's going to

131
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:21.261
be a lot bigger on my blog so people can

132
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.262
really see if the editing is bad but

133
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.263
this is just a picture for an Instagram

134
00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:26.266
post

135
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:28.268
and this is one to two hours of work and

136
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:31.270
if people just take it and pretend that

137
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:33.272
there's you know that kind of sucks for

138
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.274
a content creator because you put the

139
00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:37.276
work into it so that you know hopefully

140
00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:39.279
the people who watch your content who

141
00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:41.281
consume it enjoy it and you know I like

142
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:44.283
doing that and I have a lot of fun doing

143
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:45.285
it but it really sucks when people like

144
00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:47.287
your work so much that they want to

145
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:49.289
share it but they don't respect your

146
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:51.291
work enough to give you credit or even

147
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.292
it first of all ask if they allowed to

148
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.294
share it and at this point you're

149
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:56.295
probably wondering so what exactly

150
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:59.298
happened with your pictures that you're

151
00:04:56.295 --> 00:05:00.300
so mad so what happened with my pictures

152
00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:03.302
and people stealing them is that people

153
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.306
started using them on different apps and

154
00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:08.307
pretend that they're me basically um so

155
00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:10.309
I have people message me and be like hey

156
00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:12.311
we messaged on this in this dating app

157
00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.313
is it cool if we continue talking here

158
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:16.316
on Instagram and I'm like who are you

159
00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:19.319
what is this app I have never even heard

160
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:22.321
of it and um that is something that's

161
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.323
just not cool okay first of all if you

162
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:25.325
are stealing my picture and you're using

163
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:27.327
it on a dating app and then somebody

164
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:29.329
messages review they are thinking that

165
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:32.332
their messaging or a person that looks

166
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:34.333
like me and you know nowadays most

167
00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:36.335
people know how to do a reverse image

168
00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:37.337
search on Google okay for those of you

169
00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:39.339
guys don't know a reverse image search

170
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.340
is a search for a picture so you can

171
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.342
take a picture from your laptop and tell

172
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.344
Google search for this picture on the

173
00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:47.347
internet and I am a very searchable

174
00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:50.349
person okay I am NOT a big content

175
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:51.351
creator I'm not a celebrity at all but I

176
00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.353
have a blog that has been written for

177
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:56.356
years there are a lot of pictures of me

178
00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:59.358
on the Internet that are public and so

179
00:05:56.356 --> 00:06:01.361
you can really easily find out who I am

180
00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:03.363
if you have a picture of me and so it's

181
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:05.365
no wonder that if you use pictures that

182
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:07.367
I used on my blog or on my public

183
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:09.369
socials that these people who didn't

184
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:12.372
message review find me on my actual

185
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:14.373
socials so you know you are hurting them

186
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.375
because they think they are messaging

187
00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:17.376
with me and you know maybe they read

188
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:19.379
about my personality my blog or whatever

189
00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:20.379
and they think oh really great I really

190
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.381
want

191
00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.383
you know get to know this person but

192
00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:25.385
actually they are not messaging with me

193
00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:27.387
and I also don't know what you're

194
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:29.388
getting out of it because if you ever

195
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:31.391
done meet with these people in real life

196
00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:34.394
you're not gonna look like me okay I

197
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:36.396
don't have a twin so I don't understand

198
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:38.397
why you would do that you're hurting

199
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:40.399
yourself because you are not actually

200
00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:42.401
telling them who you really are and you

201
00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.402
are hurting other people by pretending

202
00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:45.405
to be someone you're not

203
00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:47.407
and it's really not okay and you know I

204
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:49.409
never thought that this would happen to

205
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:52.411
someone like me because I'm a very small

206
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:54.413
content creator here on YouTube and I

207
00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:56.416
have a blog and yes a couple of thousand

208
00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:58.417
people read it a month but honestly it

209
00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:00.420
down it's a very small audience in the

210
00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:03.423
internet nowadays and you know I talk

211
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.425
about pretty uncontroversial topics like

212
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:07.426
you know university related things every

213
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.428
once in a while on my blog and maybe

214
00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:11.431
talk about a beauty product that I like

215
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:13.432
about that's pretty much it so I never

216
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:15.435
really thought that people will be

217
00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:17.437
stealing my pictures or you know any

218
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.439
content that I put out there because I'm

219
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:22.441
just not that big as a content creator

220
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.442
and I know that I look pretty average so

221
00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:25.444
I just never thought that people would

222
00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:26.446
want to steal my pictures from my

223
00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:29.448
Instagram and then use it on things like

224
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:30.450
dating websites but unfortunately this

225
00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:33.453
is something that has happened to me and

226
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.454
I wanted to address it here just to let

227
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.456
you guys know that if you have one of

228
00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:39.459
these people who did it please stop

229
00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:41.461
doing it because every time you do it I

230
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.461
then have to be the person to tell

231
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.464
someone

232
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:46.465
no this isn't me and it sucks for me to

233
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:48.468
have to do that because I know that I'm

234
00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:50.470
probably hurting this person who sent me

235
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:53.473
a message and you know maybe was really

236
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.475
excited to meet somebody new and the

237
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:58.477
other thing is I don't have to go on an

238
00:07:55.475 --> 00:08:00.479
internet search find out how to contact

239
00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:02.481
this dating website and then I'm going

240
00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:04.483
to figure out how to get this profile

241
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:05.485
taken down with their customer support

242
00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:06.486
and you know it has happened to me that

243
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.488
somebody messaged me and they were

244
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:11.490
referring to a dating website which i

245
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:13.492
think is pretty shady I'm not gonna give

246
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.494
this website more publicity by promoting

247
00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:16.496
it on my channel this is not what my

248
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:19.499
channel is about but you know I don't

249
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:21.501
have to go and deal with like shady web

250
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:23.503
sites and whatever in order to get these

251
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:25.505
profiles taken down because obviously a

252
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:28.507
I don't want more people thinking I'm on

253
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:30.509
there and B I don't want you

254
00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:33.512
use my pictures and pretend to be me and

255
00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:36.516
you know then you just take another hour

256
00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:37.516
or two hours of my work because I have

257
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.519
to go

258
00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:42.521
email them prove to them that I am the

259
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:44.523
actual person and you know that's a lot

260
00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:46.525
of work proving to somebody that you are

261
00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:47.527
actually the content creator so that's

262
00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:50.529
why you know that I have to go and

263
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:51.530
explain be like see I'm emailing you

264
00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:52.532
from the right email address this is the

265
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.534
email address which is linked to my

266
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.535
YouTube account you can see it here on

267
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.537
my YouTube account

268
00:08:55.535 --> 00:09:00.540
blah blah blah you know I have to go on

269
00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:03.543
and on and on explaining and proving to

270
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:06.545
them that I am me and that is just a lot

271
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:08.548
of work it's absolutely unnecessary work

272
00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:12.551
and you are the reason that I have to do

273
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:15.554
this work and it's not cool okay it's

274
00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:17.556
just not okay I am really mad about this

275
00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:20.559
at this point because it hasn't been

276
00:09:17.556 --> 00:09:21.560
just one time and that is why I'm not

277
00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.562
okay with it and that is why I'm making

278
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.565
this video and I'm really sorry for this

279
00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:27.567
negative content but I just think it had

280
00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:30.569
to be out there and I hope that you guys

281
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:32.571
now understand that you may just see a

282
00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:34.573
picture that is really easy to just take

283
00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:36.576
from my socials and put on your own

284
00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:38.578
profile but I hope you can understand

285
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:41.580
that I put a lot of work into any

286
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:43.582
content I put out there and that I also

287
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.585
then have to put in a lot of work to get

288
00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:47.586
your fake profiles taken down and that

289
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:49.589
is just not fair to me okay I'm a

290
00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:51.591
university student I have better things

291
00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:54.593
to do than email some weird dating

292
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:55.595
websites and be like hi I'm actually me

295
00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:02.602

afternoons so please don't make me spend

297
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.605

298
00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:07.606
been through my rant about people

299
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:10.610
stealing my pictures and pretending to

300
00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:13.612
be me let's get into people stealing my

301
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.614
work here on YouTube so what has

302
00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:17.617
happened to me is that somebody took my

303
00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:19.619
video uploaded it in the same length and

304
00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:21.621
you know just the entire video on their

305
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:25.624
own account somewhere else and posted it

306
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:27.626
and that is not okay now I am aware if

307
00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:29.628
you are allowed to use content from

308
00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:31.630
other creators if you use it for

309
00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:33.632
commentary for parody or for anything

310
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.634
like that but that is not what happened

311
00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:37.637
here at all the passengers took the

312
00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:39.638
entire video and uploaded it

313
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:41.641
on their own account on a different

314
00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:43.642
video sharing website and that's really

315
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:45.645
not okay and I want to explain to you

316
00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:47.646
guys why so before we get into it this

317
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:49.649
is the video that was stolen and where

318
00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:51.651
it was uploaded and this is a Chinese

319
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:55.654
website and in all honesty my Chinese is

320
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:57.656
pretty horrible so I don't know how to

321
00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:58.658
get it taken down if you guys have had

322
00:10:57.656 --> 00:11:00.660
any experience with this please let me

323
00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:02.662
know because I really do want to get it

324
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.663
out of there because it doesn't belong

325
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:06.665
there now before somebody finds out in

326
00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:08.667
the comments yes I am aware that YouTube

327
00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:11.670
is blocked in China and it you can only

328
00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:13.672
access it using a VPN connection and if

329
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.674
somebody was lived in Hong Kong for two

330
00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:17.676
years and who has many friends in a

331
00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:18.678
Chinese mainland I do understand there

332
00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:20.679
are a lot of people who want to share

333
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:22.681
content that is available to students

334
00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:24.683
around the world with Chinese students

335
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:26.685
because many of them just can't access

336
00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:28.687
it because they're in China and YouTube

337
00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:30.690
and average services are blocked there I

338
00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:32.692
fully understand that but if you are

339
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.694
somebody like that and you think that

340
00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:37.696
the content of one creator is so good

341
00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:39.699
that Chinese students should have access

342
00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:42.701
to it as well then why are you not

343
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:44.703
respecting the content creator enough to

344
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:47.706
ask them for permission I am somebody

345
00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:49.708
who has a connection to China I'm

346
00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:51.710
somebody really understand that problem

347
00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:53.713
so why don't you send me a message and

348
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.715
simply ask for permission under every

349
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:58.717
video of mine the contact section of my

350
00:11:55.715 --> 00:12:00.720
blog is linked in the info box all my

351
00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:02.722
socials are linked under my videos you

352
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.724
can always drop me a message there and

353
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:07.726
be like hey I want to do that Matt

354
00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:11.730
could I please share it but if you don't

355
00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:13.733
ask the answer is always no okay and if

356
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.735
you ask and I say no then it's a no then

357
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:18.737
you don't have permission to go steal my

358
00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:20.740
video and upload it somewhere else you

359
00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:23.742
simply don't have permission you don't

360
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:26.745
own the content you haven't put hours of

361
00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:28.748
work into this content so it's not yours

362
00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:31.750
so don't take it and there's also

363
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:33.753
financial aspect to this because you are

364
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.755
basically stealing my money if you take

365
00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:38.757
my work and you upload it somewhere else

366
00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:39.759
and I don't get paid for that so the

367
00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:41.760
thing is whenever you click on my

368
00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:43.763
YouTube video there's usually an ad

369
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.764
that's playing in a video and the reason

370
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:47.766
for that is that I'm a member of the

371
00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.767
YouTube Partner Program so I get a

372
00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:50.769
little

373
00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:52.771
of money every time these ads play but

374
00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:54.773
the thing is that is not a lot so I am

375
00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:56.775
NOT here and saying you know I'm doing

376
00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:57.777
YouTube for the money I'm really not but

377
00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:59.778
the thing is there is a lot of costs

378
00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.781
that are associated with having your

379
00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:04.783
channel and you know having this little

380
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:06.785
revenue from ads just helps me to

381
00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:08.787
finance this channel because it's really

382
00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:09.788
not that easy if you're a university

383
00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:11.790
student and I just quickly wanted to

384
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:13.792
give you guys a short outline of how

385
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.795
many things I actually have to pay for

386
00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:17.796
as a content creator okay so I have a

387
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:19.798
tripod that is something that I bought

388
00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:20.799
with my own money I have a video camera

389
00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:22.802
which are also bought with my own money

390
00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:24.804
I have a MacBook Pro which I use for

391
00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:27.806
editing which are also paid for with my

392
00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:29.808
own money and then I always have to pay

393
00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:31.810
for my editing software then I also have

394
00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:33.813
to pay for my photo editing software

395
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.815
because those thumbnails aren't creating

396
00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:38.817
themselves and then I also have to pay

397
00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:40.819
for licenses for the fonts that I'm

398
00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:42.821
using in my thumbnails because other

399
00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:45.824
people created these funds and I respect

400
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:47.826
their work enough to pay for it so why

401
00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:50.829
aren't you respecting my work enough to

402
00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:52.831
allow me to make a few cents from it in

403
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:54.833
order to then keep financing my work and

404
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:56.835
keep doing this if you think my content

405
00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:58.837
is great thank you so much but please

406
00:13:56.835 --> 00:14:00.839
respect me and have as a content creator

407
00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:02.841
to not steal it because that's really

408
00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:04.843
not cool you know I'm really not doing

409
00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:06.845
YouTube for the money because all the

410
00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:07.846
things that I just told you about that

411
00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:09.848
I've paid for with my own money

412
00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:12.851
those are thousands and thousands of

413
00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:14.853
dollars okay I mean everybody knows how

414
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:16.855
much MacBooks are nowadays and all these

415
00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:18.858
things you can probably guess that I've

416
00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:21.860
spent at least three thousand dollars

417
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:24.863
just on being able to make this channel

418
00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.865
and that is a lot of money and in all

419
00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:28.868
honesty I haven't made something that's

420
00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:31.870
even close to that from YouTube since I

421
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:33.872
started monetizing my videos and that's

422
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.874
absolutely okay because I'm not doing

423
00:14:33.872 --> 00:14:37.876
this for the money but you know just

424
00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:39.879
having a bit of money that comes back

425
00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:41.880
from these videos it really helps me as

426
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:44.883
a content creator to keep making them

427
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:47.886
because I have a very limited financial

428
00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:48.888
ability and I'm a student so you know

429
00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:51.890
there is not much money that I can spend

430
00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:53.892
on this channel but I nonetheless made

431
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.894
it possible and you know that was

432
00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:57.896
already a lot of work just to be able to

433
00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:58.897
buy these things I had to work in order

434
00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.898
to

435
00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:01.900
have this money to then start this

436
00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:03.902
channel and I don't regret doing that

437
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.904
not tool you know I would do it all

438
00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:07.906
again because I really love making

439
00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:09.908
videos I really enjoy interacting with

440
00:15:07.906 --> 00:15:12.911
you guys but you know if you didn't take

441
00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:15.914
my video and steal it it just makes me

442
00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:17.916
upset and then I don't have fun doing

443
00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:19.918
this anymore and I just think it's very

444
00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:21.920
disrespectful towards any content

445
00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:23.922
creator if you steal their work and just

446
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.925
straight-up upload it somewhere else and

447
00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:27.926
yes this person did then you know link

448
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:29.929
everything that I had linked in my

449
00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:32.931
infobox but that is not enough you

450
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:34.933
cannot just take somebody's content not

451
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:37.936
use it for commentary or anything just

452
00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:38.938
upload it somewhere else without the

453
00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:40.940
monetization that these people are

454
00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:43.943
actually entitled to with their videos

455
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:46.945
and just be like well I mean I gave them

456
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:49.948
credit but I actually stole their source

457
00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:52.951
of income by doing so thank you so much

458
00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:54.953
for crediting me it is not helping and

459
00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:55.954
if the person who has uploaded it on

460
00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:57.957
this Chinese website is watching this

461
00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:59.958
please take this video down it's

462
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:01.960
absolutely disgusting to steal

463
00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.962
somebody's work without permission and

464
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.964
thereby take away their source of income

465
00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:08.967
which they need in order to pay for

466
00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:09.968
creating this content it's not ok and if

467
00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:12.971
you are somebody who wants to make my

468
00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:15.974
videos more accessible please message me

469
00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:17.976
tell me about your ideas tell me where

470
00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:19.978
you want to share it what your audience

471
00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:22.981
is if you already have an audience there

472
00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:23.982
let me know and I make an informed

473
00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:25.984
decision do what I want you to be able

474
00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:28.987
to share these videos or not I have had

475
00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:31.990
people reach out to me via my blog and

476
00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:33.992
ask hey there is a post that I really

477
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:36.995
want to share in China but I know that I

478
00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:38.997
can't share this video there would it be

479
00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:40.999
okay if I shared it really chat or

480
00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:43.100
something else and you know then I think

481
00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:44.100
about it you know I decide is it worth

482
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.100
it is it not do I want to take this risk

483
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:51.101
yes or no and if I say yes then it's a

484
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:54.101
green light go ahead if it's a no it's a

485
00:16:51.101 --> 00:16:57.101
note and then don't use my work because

486
00:16:54.101 --> 00:16:59.101
it's my work I've put hours of work into

487
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:01.102
creating a concept writing outlines

488
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:03.102
filming it editing it creating a

489
00:17:01.102 --> 00:17:06.102
thumbnail creating the text on the info

490
00:17:03.102 --> 00:17:08.102
box and then posting it and promoting it

491
00:17:06.102 --> 00:17:11.103
on my socials so you taking it away just

492
00:17:08.102 --> 00:17:13.103
like that it's not cool

493
00:17:11.103 --> 00:17:16.103
so please don't do it please don't do it

494
00:17:13.103 --> 00:17:17.103
to any content creator and I hope that

495
00:17:16.103 --> 00:17:21.104
this video just helped you guys

496
00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:22.104
understand why content creators get so

497
00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:25.104
emotional when people steal their work

498
00:17:22.104 --> 00:17:27.104
because we put a lot of work into it

499
00:17:25.104 --> 00:17:29.104
even me as a very very small content

500
00:17:27.104 --> 00:17:31.105
creator of only a few thousand

501
00:17:29.104 --> 00:17:33.105
subscribers even I put a lot of work

502
00:17:31.105 --> 00:17:35.105
into it and you know you may not always

503
00:17:33.105 --> 00:17:37.105
see that you know you just watch a ten

504
00:17:35.105 --> 00:17:39.105
minute video and then you move on but

505
00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:42.106
please remember everybody who puts

506
00:17:39.105 --> 00:17:45.106
videos out there puts hours of work into

507
00:17:42.106 --> 00:17:47.106
it so you know respect everybody who

508
00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:49.106
does this work for you enough to just

509
00:17:47.106 --> 00:17:51.107
credit their work and if you are sharing

510
00:17:49.106 --> 00:17:54.107
it somewhere and it's actually monetized

511
00:17:51.107 --> 00:17:56.107
on another platform ask the content

512
00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:59.107
creator if you're allowed to do so and

513
00:17:56.107 --> 00:18:04.108
if they say no please respect him enough

514
00:17:59.107 --> 00:18:04.108
to take their no for what it is and no
