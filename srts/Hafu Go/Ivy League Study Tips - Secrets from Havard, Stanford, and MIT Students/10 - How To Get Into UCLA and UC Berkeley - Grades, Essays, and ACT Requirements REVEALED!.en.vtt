00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.889 align:start position:0%
didn't end with a 4.0 but I had like a
3.9<00:00:48.589><c> so</c><00:00:49.579><c> I</c><00:00:49.609><c> think</c><00:00:49.760><c> that</c><00:00:50.030><c> contra</c><00:00:50.390><c> buted</c><00:00:50.629><c> to</c><00:00:50.749><c> it</c>

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 align:start position:0%
3.9 so I think that contra buted to it
 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
3.9 so I think that contra buted to it
but<00:00:51.170><c> obviously</c><00:00:51.710><c> I</c><00:00:51.800><c> don't</c><00:00:51.949><c> think</c><00:00:52.159><c> it's</c><00:00:52.249><c> not</c><00:00:52.370><c> the</c>

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 align:start position:0%
but obviously I don't think it's not the
 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.059 align:start position:0%
but obviously I don't think it's not the
whole<00:00:52.670><c> reason</c><00:00:52.699><c> why</c><00:00:53.239><c> I</c><00:00:53.269><c> got</c><00:00:53.749><c> in</c><00:00:53.929><c> and</c><00:00:54.230><c> then</c><00:00:54.469><c> did</c>
