means we can't open the telescope it's
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.950 align:start position:0%
means we can't open the telescope it's
also

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
which is really really frustrating so i
 

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.230 align:start position:0%
which is really really frustrating so i
mean<00:14:41.040><c> i</c><00:14:41.120><c> guess</c><00:14:41.279><c> i</c><00:14:41.440><c> shouldn't</c><00:14:41.760><c> write</c><00:14:41.920><c> off</c><00:14:42.079><c> the</c>

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
mean i guess i shouldn't write off the
 

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.350 align:start position:0%
mean i guess i shouldn't write off the
night<00:14:42.560><c> yet</c><00:14:42.880><c> i</c><00:14:42.959><c> mean</c>

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
night yet i mean
 

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.710 align:start position:0%
night yet i mean
you<00:14:43.600><c> never</c><00:14:44.000><c> know</c><00:14:44.639><c> right</c><00:14:45.279><c> it</c><00:14:45.680><c> could</c>

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
you never know right it could
 

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.910 align:start position:0%
you never know right it could
come<00:14:47.040><c> clear</c><00:14:47.760><c> and</c><00:14:47.920><c> we</c><00:14:48.240><c> could</c><00:14:49.440><c> have</c>

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
come clear and we could have
 

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.949 align:start position:0%
come clear and we could have
even<00:14:50.560><c> just</c><00:14:50.959><c> a</c><00:14:51.199><c> little</c><00:14:51.600><c> bit</c><00:14:51.920><c> of</c><00:14:52.079><c> data</c><00:14:52.720><c> by</c>

00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
even just a little bit of data by
 

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:54.069 align:start position:0%
even just a little bit of data by
tomorrow<00:14:53.360><c> morning</c><00:14:53.680><c> even</c>

tomorrow morning even
 

00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:56.790 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning even
just<00:14:54.320><c> observed</c><00:14:54.880><c> one</c><00:14:55.279><c> galaxy</c><00:14:56.240><c> that</c><00:14:56.399><c> would</c><00:14:56.560><c> be</c>

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
just observed one galaxy that would be
 

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.269 align:start position:0%
just observed one galaxy that would be
awesome

00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
awesome
 

00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:00.069 align:start position:0%

that maybe we would be able to open the

i<00:15:22.480><c> really</c><00:15:22.639><c> wanted</c><00:15:22.800><c> to</c><00:15:22.880><c> show</c><00:15:23.040><c> you</c><00:15:23.120><c> guys</c><00:15:23.360><c> though</c>

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
i really wanted to show you guys though
 

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.110 align:start position:0%
i really wanted to show you guys though
like<00:15:24.000><c> what</c><00:15:25.120><c> data</c><00:15:25.839><c> that</c><00:15:26.160><c> comes</c><00:15:26.560><c> fresh</c><00:15:26.880><c> off</c><00:15:26.959><c> the</c>

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
like what data that comes fresh off the
 

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.110 align:start position:0%
like what data that comes fresh off the
telescope<00:15:27.680><c> actually</c><00:15:28.079><c> looks</c><00:15:28.399><c> like</c>

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
telescope actually looks like
 

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.870 align:start position:0%
telescope actually looks like
so<00:15:29.519><c> i</c><00:15:30.160><c> dug</c><00:15:30.720><c> into</c><00:15:31.440><c> all</c><00:15:31.680><c> of</c><00:15:31.839><c> my</c><00:15:32.160><c> external</c><00:15:32.639><c> hard</c>

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
so i dug into all of my external hard
 

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.829 align:start position:0%
so i dug into all of my external hard
drives<00:15:33.279><c> and</c><00:15:33.600><c> found</c><00:15:34.000><c> the</c><00:15:34.160><c> data</c><00:15:34.480><c> that</c><00:15:34.639><c> we</c><00:15:34.880><c> took</c>

00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
drives and found the data that we took
 

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:39.030 align:start position:0%
drives and found the data that we took
back<00:15:36.240><c> in</c><00:15:36.920><c> 2014.</c><00:15:38.240><c> now</c>

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
back in 2014. now
 

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.710 align:start position:0%
back in 2014. now
these<00:15:39.279><c> aren't</c><00:15:39.600><c> bad</c><00:15:39.920><c> galaxies</c><00:15:40.399><c> these</c><00:15:40.560><c> are</c>

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
these aren't bad galaxies these are
 

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.790 align:start position:0%
these aren't bad galaxies these are
actually<00:15:41.120><c> um</c><00:15:41.519><c> what</c><00:15:41.680><c> we</c><00:15:41.759><c> call</c><00:15:42.000><c> agn</c><00:15:42.480><c> so</c><00:15:42.639><c> they're</c>

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
actually um what we call agn so they're
 

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.710 align:start position:0%
actually um what we call agn so they're
galaxies<00:15:43.279><c> with</c><00:15:43.519><c> growing</c><00:15:43.839><c> black</c><00:15:44.079><c> holes</c>

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
galaxies with growing black holes
 

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.110 align:start position:0%
galaxies with growing black holes
but<00:15:45.040><c> still</c><00:15:45.920><c> we</c><00:15:46.160><c> were</c><00:15:46.320><c> still</c><00:15:46.480><c> taking</c><00:15:46.720><c> the</c><00:15:46.800><c> exact</c>

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
but still we were still taking the exact
 

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.629 align:start position:0%
but still we were still taking the exact
same<00:15:47.279><c> thing</c><00:15:47.440><c> we</c><00:15:47.519><c> were</c><00:15:47.680><c> taking</c><00:15:48.000><c> a</c><00:15:48.079><c> spectra</c>

00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
same thing we were taking a spectra
 

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:50.230 align:start position:0%
same thing we were taking a spectra
which<00:15:48.800><c> is</c><00:15:48.880><c> where</c><00:15:49.120><c> you</c><00:15:49.199><c> put</c><00:15:49.440><c> the</c><00:15:49.680><c> slit</c>

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
which is where you put the slit
 

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.550 align:start position:0%
which is where you put the slit
along<00:15:50.560><c> the</c><00:15:50.720><c> galaxy</c><00:15:51.519><c> and</c><00:15:51.680><c> then</c><00:15:51.839><c> you</c><00:15:52.079><c> end</c><00:15:52.399><c> up</c>

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
along the galaxy and then you end up
 

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
along the galaxy and then you end up
with<00:15:52.800><c> something</c><00:15:53.199><c> that</c><00:15:53.440><c> looks</c><00:15:53.920><c> like</c>

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
with something that looks like
 

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.430 align:start position:0%
with something that looks like
this<00:15:55.199><c> when</c><00:15:55.360><c> it</c><00:15:55.519><c> comes</c><00:15:55.920><c> straight</c><00:15:56.399><c> fresh</c><00:15:56.800><c> off</c>

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
this when it comes straight fresh off
 

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.030 align:start position:0%
this when it comes straight fresh off
the<00:15:57.600><c> telescope</c><00:15:58.240><c> okay</c><00:15:58.399><c> so</c><00:15:58.480><c> what</c><00:15:58.639><c> you're</c><00:15:58.800><c> seeing</c>

00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
the telescope okay so what you're seeing
 

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.710 align:start position:0%
the telescope okay so what you're seeing
here<00:15:59.279><c> this</c><00:15:59.600><c> bright</c><00:16:00.160><c> line</c>

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
here this bright line
 

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.150 align:start position:0%
here this bright line
down<00:16:00.959><c> the</c><00:16:01.040><c> middle</c><00:16:02.160><c> is</c><00:16:02.399><c> the</c><00:16:02.560><c> actual</c><00:16:03.279><c> galaxy</c>

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
down the middle is the actual galaxy
 

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.990 align:start position:0%
down the middle is the actual galaxy
so<00:16:04.480><c> the</c><00:16:04.560><c> way</c><00:16:04.720><c> you</c><00:16:04.880><c> can</c><00:16:05.040><c> think</c><00:16:05.279><c> of</c><00:16:05.600><c> this</c><00:16:05.839><c> because</c>

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
so the way you can think of this because
 

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.910 align:start position:0%
so the way you can think of this because
it<00:16:06.240><c> is</c><00:16:06.399><c> an</c><00:16:06.639><c> image</c><00:16:06.880><c> but</c><00:16:07.040><c> it's</c><00:16:07.199><c> an</c><00:16:07.279><c> image</c><00:16:07.519><c> of</c><00:16:07.680><c> a</c>

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
it is an image but it's an image of a
 

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.509 align:start position:0%
it is an image but it's an image of a

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
spectra where you've split the light
 

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:11.430 align:start position:0%
spectra where you've split the light

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
into its component wavelength so along
 

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.870 align:start position:0%
into its component wavelength so along
here<00:16:11.839><c> down</c><00:16:12.160><c> i</c><00:16:12.240><c> guess</c><00:16:12.399><c> what</c><00:16:12.560><c> you</c><00:16:12.560><c> could</c><00:16:12.720><c> call</c>

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
here down i guess what you could call
 

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.150 align:start position:0%
here down i guess what you could call
the<00:16:12.959><c> y-axis</c>

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
the y-axis
 

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
the y-axis
is<00:16:14.800><c> wavelengths</c><00:16:15.519><c> and</c><00:16:15.600><c> then</c><00:16:15.839><c> the</c><00:16:16.000><c> x-axis</c><00:16:16.720><c> here</c>

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
is wavelengths and then the x-axis here
 

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.069 align:start position:0%
is wavelengths and then the x-axis here
is<00:16:17.199><c> sort</c><00:16:17.360><c> of</c><00:16:17.440><c> like</c>

00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
is sort of like
 

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:19.509 align:start position:0%
is sort of like

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
space across the sky it's like we've
 

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:21.430 align:start position:0%

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
taken everything in the slit and sort of
 

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.710 align:start position:0%
taken everything in the slit and sort of
condensed<00:16:21.920><c> it</c><00:16:22.079><c> into</c>

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
condensed it into
 

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.350 align:start position:0%
condensed it into

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.710 align:start position:0%

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.590 align:start position:0%

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
little function that can do that then
 

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.190 align:start position:0%
little function that can do that then
you<00:18:49.760><c> end</c><00:18:49.919><c> up</c><00:18:50.000><c> with</c><00:18:50.160><c> something</c><00:18:50.400><c> that</c><00:18:50.559><c> looks</c><00:18:50.960><c> um</c>

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
you end up with something that looks um
 

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:51.830 align:start position:0%
you end up with something that looks um
like<00:18:51.440><c> this</c>

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
like this
 

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.070 align:start position:0%
like this
right<00:18:52.400><c> and</c><00:18:52.559><c> so</c><00:18:52.720><c> what</c><00:18:52.880><c> you</c><00:18:53.039><c> can</c><00:18:53.120><c> see</c><00:18:53.360><c> is</c><00:18:53.760><c> this</c><00:18:53.919><c> is</c>

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
right and so what you can see is this is
 

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
right and so what you can see is this is
wavelength<00:18:54.640><c> now</c><00:18:54.960><c> on</c><00:18:55.120><c> the</c><00:18:55.280><c> x-axis</c>

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
wavelength now on the x-axis
 

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.750 align:start position:0%
wavelength now on the x-axis
but<00:18:56.080><c> we've</c><00:18:56.320><c> not</c><00:18:56.480><c> calibrated</c><00:18:57.120><c> it</c><00:18:57.280><c> yet</c><00:18:57.440><c> in</c><00:18:57.520><c> terms</c>

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
but we've not calibrated it yet in terms
 

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.270 align:start position:0%
but we've not calibrated it yet in terms
of<00:18:57.840><c> what</c><00:18:58.000><c> wavelength</c><00:18:58.480><c> or</c><00:18:58.640><c> color</c><00:18:58.880><c> it</c><00:18:59.039><c> actually</c>

00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
of what wavelength or color it actually
 

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.390 align:start position:0%
of what wavelength or color it actually
is<00:18:59.360><c> so</c><00:18:59.520><c> we've</c><00:18:59.600><c> just</c><00:18:59.760><c> got</c><00:18:59.919><c> it</c><00:19:00.000><c> in</c><00:19:00.080><c> terms</c><00:19:00.320><c> of</c>

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
is so we've just got it in terms of
 

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.029 align:start position:0%
is so we've just got it in terms of
pixels

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
pixels
 

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:02.470 align:start position:0%
pixels
and<00:19:01.120><c> then</c><00:19:01.280><c> we've</c><00:19:01.440><c> sort</c><00:19:01.600><c> of</c><00:19:01.679><c> got</c><00:19:01.840><c> the</c><00:19:02.000><c> number</c><00:19:02.240><c> of</c>

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
and then we've sort of got the number of
 

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.390 align:start position:0%
and then we've sort of got the number of
photons<00:19:02.960><c> that</c><00:19:03.120><c> we</c><00:19:03.200><c> detected</c><00:19:03.679><c> in</c><00:19:03.840><c> each</c><00:19:04.000><c> pixel</c>

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
photons that we detected in each pixel
 

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.669 align:start position:0%
photons that we detected in each pixel
at<00:19:04.480><c> the</c><00:19:04.559><c> number</c><00:19:04.799><c> of</c><00:19:04.960><c> counts</c>

00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
at the number of counts
 

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:06.630 align:start position:0%
at the number of counts
and<00:19:05.840><c> you</c><00:19:05.919><c> can</c><00:19:06.080><c> see</c><00:19:06.240><c> that</c><00:19:06.400><c> what</c><00:19:06.480><c> we're</c>

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
and you can see that what we're
 

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
and you can see that what we're
detecting<00:19:07.039><c> now</c><00:19:07.200><c> is</c><00:19:07.360><c> just</c><00:19:07.679><c> galaxy</c><00:19:08.080><c> there's</c><00:19:08.400><c> big</c>

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.950 align:start position:0%
detecting now is just galaxy there's big
feature<00:19:09.600><c> here</c><00:19:10.000><c> is</c><00:19:10.160><c> actually</c><00:19:10.480><c> emission</c><00:19:10.799><c> from</c>

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
feature here is actually emission from
 

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.870 align:start position:0%
feature here is actually emission from

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
hydrogen and in this case it's very
 

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.390 align:start position:0%
hydrogen and in this case it's very
broad<00:19:13.200><c> because</c><00:19:13.440><c> what</c><00:19:13.520><c> we're</c><00:19:13.679><c> looking</c><00:19:14.000><c> at</c><00:19:14.080><c> here</c>

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
broad because what we're looking at here
 

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.669 align:start position:0%
broad because what we're looking at here
is<00:19:14.480><c> a</c><00:19:14.559><c> growing</c><00:19:14.880><c> black</c><00:19:15.039><c> hole</c><00:19:15.280><c> that's</c><00:19:15.520><c> got</c>

00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
is a growing black hole that's got
 

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:17.270 align:start position:0%
is a growing black hole that's got

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
hydrogen spiraling around it so you've
 

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
hydrogen spiraling around it so you've
got<00:19:17.520><c> some</c><00:19:17.760><c> that's</c><00:19:18.000><c> redshifted</c><00:19:18.640><c> and</c><00:19:18.720><c> some</c>

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
got some that's redshifted and some
 

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.029 align:start position:0%
got some that's redshifted and some
that's<00:19:19.200><c> blue</c><00:19:19.440><c> shifted</c><00:19:19.919><c> and</c><00:19:20.000><c> so</c><00:19:20.160><c> it's</c><00:19:20.320><c> not</c><00:19:20.480><c> this</c>

00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
that's blue shifted and so it's not this
 

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:23.270 align:start position:0%
that's blue shifted and so it's not this
very<00:19:21.440><c> sort</c><00:19:21.600><c> of</c><00:19:22.080><c> thin</c><00:19:22.400><c> peak</c><00:19:22.720><c> it's</c><00:19:22.880><c> this</c><00:19:23.039><c> nice</c>

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
very sort of thin peak it's this nice
 

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.549 align:start position:0%
very sort of thin peak it's this nice
broad<00:19:23.760><c> peak</c>

00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
broad peak
 

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.789 align:start position:0%
broad peak
so<00:19:24.799><c> if</c><00:19:24.880><c> we</c><00:19:25.039><c> did</c><00:19:25.280><c> actually</c><00:19:25.520><c> get</c><00:19:25.679><c> data</c><00:19:26.240><c> of</c><00:19:26.640><c> the</c>

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
so if we did actually get data of the

so if we did actually get data of the
