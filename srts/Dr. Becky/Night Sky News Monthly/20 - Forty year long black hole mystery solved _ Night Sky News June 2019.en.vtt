accretion disk around the black hole and

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is because that
 

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is because that

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:52.650 align:start position:0%
material has been set spinning because
 

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.470 align:start position:0%
material has been set spinning because
it's<00:09:52.920><c> orbiting</c><00:09:53.340><c> around</c><00:09:53.460><c> the</c><00:09:53.700><c> black</c><00:09:53.880><c> hole</c><00:09:53.910><c> so</c>

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's orbiting around the black hole so
 

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.270 align:start position:0%
it's orbiting around the black hole so
just<00:09:54.810><c> like</c><00:09:54.960><c> when</c><00:09:55.110><c> you</c><00:09:55.200><c> take</c><00:09:55.410><c> a</c><00:09:55.620><c> lump</c><00:09:55.800><c> of</c><00:09:56.010><c> pizza</c>

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:10.890 align:start position:0%
