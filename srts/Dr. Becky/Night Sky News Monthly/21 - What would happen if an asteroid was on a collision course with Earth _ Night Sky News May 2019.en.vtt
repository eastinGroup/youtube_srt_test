00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 align:start position:0%

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 align:start position:0%
so in the summer we never actually get
 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
so in the summer we never actually get

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.430 align:start position:0%
into what's classified astronomically as

well only ever in astronomical Twilight
 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.740 align:start position:0%
well only ever in astronomical Twilight
so<00:03:00.170><c> you</c><00:03:00.290><c> have</c><00:03:00.500><c> civil</c><00:03:01.340><c> twilight</c><00:03:01.750><c> nautical</c>

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 align:start position:0%
so you have civil twilight nautical
 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.630 align:start position:0%
so you have civil twilight nautical
Twilight<00:03:02.870><c> then</c><00:03:03.530><c> your</c><00:03:03.680><c> astronomical</c><00:03:04.340><c> Twilight</c>

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
Twilight then your astronomical Twilight
 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
Twilight then your astronomical Twilight
and<00:03:05.120><c> then</c><00:03:05.269><c> full-on</c><00:03:05.750><c> nighttime</c>

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 align:start position:0%
and then full-on nighttime
 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.170 align:start position:0%
and then full-on nighttime
which<00:03:06.890><c> basically</c><00:03:07.130><c> means</c><00:03:07.370><c> you</c><00:03:07.459><c> can</c><00:03:07.700><c> then</c><00:03:07.880><c> do</c>

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 align:start position:0%
which basically means you can then do
 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.690 align:start position:0%
which basically means you can then do

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:53.450 align:start position:0%
brightens the politicians into play as
 

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.990 align:start position:0%
brightens the politicians into play as
well<00:13:53.690><c> especially</c><00:13:54.560><c> because</c><00:13:54.950><c> the</c><00:13:55.640><c> delegates</c>

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
well especially because the delegates
 

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.580 align:start position:0%
well especially because the delegates
also<00:13:56.180><c> say</c><00:13:56.510><c> well</c><00:13:56.750><c> those</c><00:13:56.870><c> reconnaissance</c>

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:57.590 align:start position:0%
also say well those reconnaissance
 

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.220 align:start position:0%
also say well those reconnaissance
missions<00:13:57.950><c> we</c><00:13:58.520><c> better</c><00:13:58.760><c> just</c><00:13:59.060><c> put</c><00:13:59.330><c> maybe</c><00:13:59.630><c> a</c><00:13:59.780><c> nuke</c>

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:00.230 align:start position:0%
missions we better just put maybe a nuke
 

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.530 align:start position:0%
missions we better just put maybe a nuke
on<00:14:00.620><c> one</c><00:14:00.890><c> of</c><00:14:00.920><c> those</c><00:14:01.160><c> in</c><00:14:01.460><c> case</c><00:14:01.670><c> this</c><00:14:01.970><c> redirection</c>

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:02.540 align:start position:0%
on one of those in case this redirection
 

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.170 align:start position:0%
on one of those in case this redirection
plan<00:14:03.380><c> goes</c><00:14:03.740><c> wrong</c><00:14:03.950><c> and</c><00:14:04.520><c> we</c><00:14:04.880><c> can</c><00:14:05.030><c> then</c><00:14:05.150><c> just</c>

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:05.180 align:start position:0%
plan goes wrong and we can then just
 

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
plan goes wrong and we can then just
maybe<00:14:05.570><c> blow</c><00:14:05.990><c> up</c><00:14:06.110><c> blast</c><00:14:06.380><c> roid</c><00:14:06.680><c> as</c><00:14:06.920><c> like</c><00:14:07.340><c> a</c><00:14:07.370><c> last</c>

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:07.850 align:start position:0%
maybe blow up blast roid as like a last
 

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.450 align:start position:0%
maybe blow up blast roid as like a last
result<00:14:08.330><c> so</c><00:14:09.140><c> the</c><00:14:09.230><c> politicians</c><00:14:09.710><c> really</c><00:14:10.070><c> do</c><00:14:10.190><c> step</c>

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:10.460 align:start position:0%
result so the politicians really do step
 

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.190 align:start position:0%
result so the politicians really do step
in<00:14:10.610><c> here</c><00:14:10.760><c> because</c><00:14:10.910><c> if</c><00:14:11.150><c> you</c><00:14:11.180><c> start</c><00:14:11.720><c> launching</c><00:14:12.110><c> a</c>

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:12.200 align:start position:0%
in here because if you start launching a
 

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
in here because if you start launching a

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:14.570 align:start position:0%
nuke on a rocket in a spacecraft are you
 

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.300 align:start position:0%
nuke on a rocket in a spacecraft are you
violating<00:14:15.170><c> a</c><00:14:15.230><c> little</c><00:14:15.470><c> like</c><00:14:15.620><c> international</c>

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:16.310 align:start position:0%
violating a little like international
 

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.990 align:start position:0%
violating a little like international
treaties<00:14:17.170><c> etc</c><00:14:18.170><c> so</c><00:14:18.770><c> that's</c><00:14:19.340><c> why</c><00:14:19.520><c> they're</c><00:14:19.790><c> there</c>

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.180 align:start position:0%
treaties etc so that's why they're there
to<00:14:20.210><c> sort</c><00:14:20.360><c> of</c><00:14:20.420><c> try</c><00:14:20.630><c> and</c><00:14:20.780><c> hash</c><00:14:21.050><c> that</c><00:14:21.350><c> out</c><00:14:21.410><c> as</c><00:14:21.830><c> well</c>

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:22.190 align:start position:0%
to sort of try and hash that out as well
 

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.980 align:start position:0%
to sort of try and hash that out as well
so<00:14:22.400><c> then</c><00:14:22.520><c> by</c><00:14:22.640><c> day</c><00:14:22.700><c> four</c><00:14:23.210><c> which</c><00:14:23.600><c> is</c><00:14:23.750><c> supposed</c><00:14:23.930><c> to</c>

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:23.990 align:start position:0%
so then by day four which is supposed to
 

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.070 align:start position:0%
so then by day four which is supposed to

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
be September 2020 for NASA and JPL tell
 

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.170 align:start position:0%
be September 2020 for NASA and JPL tell
them<00:14:27.230><c> okay</c><00:14:27.620><c> the</c><00:14:27.860><c> deflector</c><00:14:28.370><c> mission</c><00:14:28.640><c> mostly</c>

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:29.180 align:start position:0%
them okay the deflector mission mostly
 

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
them okay the deflector mission mostly
worked<00:14:29.420><c> however</c><00:14:30.260><c> when</c><00:14:31.160><c> one</c><00:14:31.790><c> of</c><00:14:32.000><c> the</c>

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.210 align:start position:0%
worked however when one of the
 

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.630 align:start position:0%
worked however when one of the

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:39.650 align:start position:0%
so now the main asteroid is not going to
 

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:43.060 align:start position:0%
so now the main asteroid is not going to
