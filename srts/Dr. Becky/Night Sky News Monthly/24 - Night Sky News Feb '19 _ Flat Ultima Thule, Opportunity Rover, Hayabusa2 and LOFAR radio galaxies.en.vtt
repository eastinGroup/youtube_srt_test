00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.950 align:start position:0%
recon trying to find a space to land on
and<00:07:31.039><c> then</c><00:07:31.280><c> also</c><00:07:31.599><c> to</c><00:07:31.759><c> collect</c><00:07:32.160><c> its</c><00:07:32.319><c> sample</c><00:07:32.800><c> to</c>

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then also to collect its sample to
 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.270 align:start position:0%
and then also to collect its sample to
bring<00:07:33.199><c> it</c><00:07:33.360><c> back</c><00:07:33.520><c> for</c><00:07:33.680><c> about</c><00:07:33.960><c> 2023</c>

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
bring it back for about 2023
 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.629 align:start position:0%
bring it back for about 2023
and<00:07:35.360><c> so</c><00:07:35.520><c> it's</c><00:07:35.680><c> good</c><00:07:35.840><c> that</c><00:07:36.000><c> there's</c><00:07:36.160><c> like</c><00:07:36.400><c> two</c>

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
and so it's good that there's like two
 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.309 align:start position:0%
and so it's good that there's like two
missions<00:07:37.199><c> japanese</c><00:07:37.680><c> and</c><00:07:37.759><c> american</c><00:07:38.080><c> led</c>

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
missions japanese and american led
 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:38.710 align:start position:0%
missions japanese and american led
mission

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
mission
 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.070 align:start position:0%
mission
and<00:07:38.800><c> that</c><00:07:38.960><c> are</c><00:07:39.039><c> both</c><00:07:39.199><c> trying</c><00:07:39.360><c> to</c><00:07:39.440><c> do</c><00:07:39.599><c> the</c><00:07:39.759><c> same</c>

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
and that are both trying to do the same
 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
and that are both trying to do the same
thing<00:07:40.479><c> because</c><00:07:40.639><c> then</c><00:07:40.800><c> they'll</c><00:07:41.039><c> be</c><00:07:41.120><c> able</c><00:07:41.280><c> to</c>

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
thing because then they'll be able to
 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.950 align:start position:0%
thing because then they'll be able to
compare<00:07:42.080><c> results</c>

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
compare results
 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.950 align:start position:0%
compare results
uh<00:07:43.280><c> bennu</c><00:07:43.599><c> is</c><00:07:43.759><c> also</c><00:07:44.000><c> a</c><00:07:44.080><c> near-earth</c><00:07:44.560><c> asteroid</c>

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh bennu is also a near-earth asteroid
 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.790 align:start position:0%
uh bennu is also a near-earth asteroid
so<00:07:45.120><c> they'll</c><00:07:45.360><c> both</c><00:07:45.599><c> be</c><00:07:45.919><c> comparing</c>

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
so they'll both be comparing
 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.869 align:start position:0%
so they'll both be comparing
um<00:07:47.039><c> the</c><00:07:47.120><c> formation</c><00:07:47.680><c> of</c><00:07:47.840><c> these</c><00:07:48.160><c> two</c><00:07:48.479><c> separate</c>

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%

it<00:10:45.440><c> would</c><00:10:45.600><c> basically</c><00:10:46.079><c> put</c><00:10:46.320><c> itself</c><00:10:46.640><c> into</c><00:10:46.800><c> like</c>

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
it would basically put itself into like

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
um and basically it would turn off all
 

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.949 align:start position:0%
um and basically it would turn off all
like<00:10:52.240><c> non-crucial</c>

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%

systems<00:10:53.279><c> and</c><00:10:53.440><c> it</c><00:10:53.519><c> would</c><00:10:53.600><c> sort</c><00:10:53.760><c> of</c><00:10:53.839><c> go</c><00:10:54.000><c> to</c><00:10:54.160><c> sleep</c>

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
a galaxy through a prism and you get

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%

they're not 100 sure on the distance
they<00:17:59.039><c> can</c><00:17:59.200><c> make</c>

00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
they can make
 

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.549 align:start position:0%
they can make

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
light that comes from as well but
 

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.350 align:start position:0%
light that comes from as well but

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
they're not that precise
 

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.350 align:start position:0%
they're not that precise
so<00:18:05.440><c> the</c><00:18:05.600><c> spectra</c><00:18:06.000><c> follow-up</c><00:18:06.559><c> using</c><00:18:07.120><c> this</c>

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
so the spectra follow-up using this
 

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.870 align:start position:0%
so the spectra follow-up using this

because<00:18:15.200><c> then</c><00:18:15.360><c> we'll</c><00:18:15.520><c> have</c><00:18:15.679><c> very</c><00:18:15.919><c> precise</c>

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%

for all of this radio emission as well
 

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.190 align:start position:0%
