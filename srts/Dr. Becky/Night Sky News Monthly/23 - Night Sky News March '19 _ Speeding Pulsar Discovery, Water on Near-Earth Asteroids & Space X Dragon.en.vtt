in the sky in the upcoming months so
let's<00:00:15.170><c> start</c><00:00:15.410><c> with</c><00:00:15.500><c> that</c><00:00:15.559><c> by</c><00:00:16.010><c> looking</c><00:00:16.610><c> up</c>

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 align:start position:0%
let's start with that by looking up

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 align:start position:0%
moon is gonna come really close to
 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.350 align:start position:0%
moon is gonna come really close to
Saturn<00:00:26.140><c> in</c><00:00:26.650><c> the</c><00:00:26.800><c> morning</c><00:00:27.250><c> pre-dawn</c><00:00:27.970><c> in</c><00:00:28.270><c> the</c>

Saturn in the morning pre-dawn in the
southeast<00:00:28.779><c> sky</c><00:00:29.020><c> so</c><00:00:29.200><c> the</c><00:00:29.320><c> moon's</c><00:00:29.500><c> actually</c>

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
southeast sky so the moon's actually
 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.230 align:start position:0%
southeast sky so the moon's actually
only<00:00:29.890><c> gonna</c><00:00:30.010><c> be</c><00:00:30.130><c> about</c><00:00:30.220><c> two</c><00:00:30.580><c> fingers</c><00:00:31.060><c> width</c>

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
only gonna be about two fingers width
 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.930 align:start position:0%
only gonna be about two fingers width
away<00:00:31.750><c> from</c><00:00:32.380><c> Saturn</c><00:00:32.800><c> just</c><00:00:32.950><c> below</c><00:00:33.370><c> Saturn</c><00:00:33.850><c> in</c>

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 align:start position:0%
away from Saturn just below Saturn in
 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.670 align:start position:0%
away from Saturn just below Saturn in
the<00:00:34.030><c> sky</c><00:00:34.300><c> and</c><00:00:34.600><c> so</c><00:00:35.110><c> if</c><00:00:35.200><c> you</c><00:00:35.320><c> actually</c><00:00:35.470><c> have</c>

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
the sky and so if you actually have
 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.990 align:start position:0%
the sky and so if you actually have
binoculars<00:00:36.340><c> and</c><00:00:36.580><c> you</c><00:00:36.640><c> can</c><00:00:36.760><c> get</c><00:00:36.879><c> your</c>

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
binoculars and you can get your
 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.030 align:start position:0%
binoculars and you can get your
binoculars<00:00:37.180><c> on</c><00:00:37.660><c> the</c><00:00:38.140><c> moon</c><00:00:38.290><c> and</c><00:00:38.440><c> Saturn</c><00:00:38.890><c> you</c>

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
binoculars on the moon and Saturn you
 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.710 align:start position:0%
binoculars on the moon and Saturn you
should<00:00:39.250><c> be</c><00:00:39.400><c> able</c><00:00:39.489><c> to</c><00:00:39.640><c> see</c><00:00:39.879><c> them</c><00:00:40.059><c> both</c><00:00:40.300><c> in</c><00:00:40.629><c> the</c>

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
should be able to see them both in the
 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
should be able to see them both in the
same<00:00:40.900><c> field</c><00:00:41.260><c> so</c><00:00:41.440><c> it</c><00:00:41.530><c> should</c><00:00:41.680><c> be</c><00:00:41.800><c> a</c><00:00:41.830><c> really</c>

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 align:start position:0%
same field so it should be a really
 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.830 align:start position:0%

see through binoculars and also Mars
will<00:01:04.930><c> be</c><00:01:04.960><c> in</c><00:01:05.110><c> the</c><00:01:05.199><c> same</c><00:01:05.440><c> binocular</c><00:01:06.100><c> field</c><00:01:06.340><c> at</c>

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 align:start position:0%
will be in the same binocular field at
 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
will be in the same binocular field at

evening on the Saturday Mars is actually
 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
evening on the Saturday Mars is actually
hanging<00:01:12.430><c> around</c><00:01:12.670><c> the</c><00:01:12.789><c> area</c><00:01:13.030><c> of</c><00:01:13.149><c> sky</c><00:01:13.360><c> for</c><00:01:13.390><c> a</c>

hanging around the area of sky for a
 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
hanging around the area of sky for a
couple<00:01:13.930><c> of</c><00:01:14.020><c> days</c><00:01:14.170><c> around</c><00:01:14.440><c> Saturday</c><00:01:15.100><c> but</c>

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 align:start position:0%
couple of days around Saturday but
 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.910 align:start position:0%
couple of days around Saturday but
Saturday<00:01:15.820><c> is</c><00:01:15.970><c> when</c><00:01:16.000><c> it</c><00:01:16.720><c> has</c><00:01:17.410><c> its</c><00:01:17.590><c> closest</c>

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
Saturday is when it has its closest
 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
Saturday is when it has its closest
approach<00:01:18.190><c> to</c><00:01:18.250><c> pi</c><00:01:18.550><c> D</c><00:01:18.610><c> so</c><00:01:18.850><c> it's</c><00:01:18.970><c> the</c><00:01:19.090><c> best</c><00:01:19.270><c> time</c>

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
want to go to Triton is because it's
 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.470 align:start position:0%
want to go to Triton is because it's
what<00:03:54.350><c> we've</c><00:03:54.470><c> dubbed</c><00:03:54.709><c> an</c><00:03:54.830><c> ocean</c><00:03:55.489><c> world</c><00:03:56.150><c> it's</c>

what we've dubbed an ocean world it's
 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.420 align:start position:0%
what we've dubbed an ocean world it's

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 align:start position:0%
got this really thick crust of nitrogen
 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.350 align:start position:0%
got this really thick crust of nitrogen
and<00:03:58.580><c> h2o</c><00:03:59.450><c> ice</c><00:04:00.200><c> on</c><00:04:00.709><c> its</c><00:04:01.130><c> crust</c><00:04:01.580><c> around</c><00:04:01.850><c> it</c><00:04:02.209><c> but</c>

and h2o ice on its crust around it but
 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.390 align:start position:0%
and h2o ice on its crust around it but
we<00:04:02.450><c> also</c><00:04:02.690><c> know</c><00:04:03.320><c> that</c><00:04:04.010><c> it</c><00:04:04.100><c> has</c><00:04:04.190><c> a</c><00:04:04.220><c> lot</c><00:04:04.370><c> of</c>

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
we also know that it has a lot of
 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.970 align:start position:0%
we also know that it has a lot of

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 align:start position:0%
volcanic activity as well going on so we
 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.310 align:start position:0%
volcanic activity as well going on so we
think<00:04:07.160><c> it</c><00:04:07.400><c> might</c><00:04:07.610><c> be</c><00:04:07.640><c> that</c><00:04:08.540><c> they're</c><00:04:08.720><c> heating</c>

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
think it might be that they're heating
 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.620 align:start position:0%
think it might be that they're heating
the<00:04:09.530><c> inside</c><00:04:09.950><c> from</c><00:04:10.160><c> the</c><00:04:10.250><c> core</c><00:04:10.610><c> in</c><00:04:11.000><c> Triton</c><00:04:11.510><c> and</c>

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 align:start position:0%
the inside from the core in Triton and
 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.180 align:start position:0%
the inside from the core in Triton and
so<00:04:11.750><c> you</c><00:04:11.900><c> end</c><00:04:12.080><c> up</c><00:04:12.230><c> with</c><00:04:12.380><c> this</c><00:04:12.500><c> like</c><00:04:12.680><c> liquid</c>

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 align:start position:0%
so you end up with this like liquid
 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.449 align:start position:0%
