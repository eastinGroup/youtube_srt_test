a dip in the brightness of the star and
 

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.470 align:start position:0%
also has a moon possibly trailing behind
it<00:11:53.800><c> then</c><00:11:54.280><c> you</c><00:11:54.400><c> would</c><00:11:54.550><c> get</c><00:11:54.670><c> like</c><00:11:54.880><c> a</c><00:11:54.910><c> double</c><00:11:55.210><c> dip</c>

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
it then you would get like a double dip
 

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.210 align:start position:0%
it then you would get like a double dip
you<00:11:55.720><c> would</c><00:11:55.870><c> get</c><00:11:56.050><c> a</c><00:11:56.080><c> large</c><00:11:56.380><c> dip</c><00:11:56.680><c> for</c><00:11:56.860><c> the</c><00:11:56.920><c> planet</c>

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:57.220 align:start position:0%
you would get a large dip for the planet
 

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
you would get a large dip for the planet

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.170 align:start position:0%
double dip transit and then they've said
 

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
double dip transit and then they've said
