sort of in the eastern sky pre-dawn but
 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.590 align:start position:0%
sort of in the eastern sky pre-dawn but

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 align:start position:0%
going to join it and so that would be
 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.460 align:start position:0%
going to join it and so that would be
just<00:00:52.550><c> or</c><00:00:52.670><c> just</c><00:00:52.699><c> below</c><00:00:53.210><c> Venus</c><00:00:53.989><c> if</c><00:00:54.140><c> you</c><00:00:54.230><c> sort</c><00:00:54.410><c> of</c>

just or just below Venus if you sort of
 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.549 align:start position:0%
just or just below Venus if you sort of

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 align:start position:0%
you should be able to spot mercury and
 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
you should be able to spot mercury and
that's<00:01:00.830><c> gonna</c><00:01:00.979><c> get</c><00:01:01.159><c> easier</c><00:01:01.400><c> though</c>

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 align:start position:0%
that's gonna get easier though

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
fly off in space and so the idea was we
 

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
fly off in space and so the idea was we
should<00:09:39.760><c> be</c><00:09:40.000><c> seeing</c><00:09:40.210><c> hundreds</c><00:09:40.840><c> of</c><00:09:40.930><c> these</c>

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
should be seeing hundreds of these

that so the paper that came out this

00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:35.619 align:start position:0%
explain this boost in acceleration and
 

00:11:35.619 --> 00:11:36.809 align:start position:0%
explain this boost in acceleration and

so most of the paper is devoted to

in a moment now solar radiation pressure
comes<00:11:47.110><c> to</c><00:11:47.199><c> the</c><00:11:47.290><c> fact</c><00:11:47.499><c> that</c><00:11:47.589><c> you</c><00:11:47.800><c> have</c><00:11:48.069><c> photons</c>

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
comes to the fact that you have photons
 

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:51.329 align:start position:0%
comes to the fact that you have photons
coming<00:11:49.240><c> from</c><00:11:49.749><c> the</c><00:11:49.929><c> Sun</c><00:11:50.139><c> that</c><00:11:50.379><c> have</c><00:11:50.589><c> energy</c><00:11:51.129><c> and</c>

00:11:51.329 --> 00:11:51.339 align:start position:0%
coming from the Sun that have energy and
 

00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
coming from the Sun that have energy and
therefore<00:11:51.639><c> momentum</c><00:11:52.240><c> so</c><00:11:52.449><c> when</c><00:11:52.569><c> they</c><00:11:52.660><c> hit</c><00:11:52.809><c> an</c>

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:52.990 align:start position:0%
therefore momentum so when they hit an
 

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.929 align:start position:0%
therefore momentum so when they hit an
object<00:11:53.379><c> they</c><00:11:53.769><c> can</c><00:11:53.980><c> transfer</c><00:11:54.399><c> their</c><00:11:54.910><c> energy</c>

00:11:54.929 --> 00:11:54.939 align:start position:0%
object they can transfer their energy
 

00:11:54.939 --> 00:11:56.790 align:start position:0%
object they can transfer their energy
and<00:11:55.480><c> they</c><00:11:55.660><c> momentum</c><00:11:56.019><c> do</c><00:11:56.139><c> that</c><00:11:56.290><c> object</c><00:11:56.620><c> and</c>

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
and they momentum do that object and
 

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.590 align:start position:0%
and they momentum do that object and
give<00:11:57.009><c> it</c><00:11:57.100><c> a</c><00:11:57.160><c> little</c><00:11:57.279><c> speed</c><00:11:58.059><c> kick</c><00:11:58.240><c> a</c><00:11:58.269><c> little</c><00:11:58.389><c> bit</c>

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
give it a little speed kick a little bit
 

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.299 align:start position:0%
give it a little speed kick a little bit
of<00:11:58.689><c> acceleration</c><00:11:59.230><c> and</c><00:11:59.800><c> so</c><00:11:59.980><c> they</c><00:12:00.100><c> tried</c><00:12:00.279><c> to</c>

00:12:00.299 --> 00:12:00.309 align:start position:0%
of acceleration and so they tried to
 

00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
of acceleration and so they tried to
work<00:12:00.459><c> out</c><00:12:00.699><c> whether</c><00:12:01.769><c> there</c><00:12:02.769><c> could</c><00:12:03.069><c> be</c><00:12:03.100><c> enough</c>

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:03.730 align:start position:0%
work out whether there could be enough
 

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.329 align:start position:0%
work out whether there could be enough

to<00:12:06.730><c> give</c><00:12:06.910><c> it</c><00:12:07.059><c> that</c><00:12:07.420><c> boost</c><00:12:07.720><c> in</c><00:12:08.050><c> acceleration</c>

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:08.470 align:start position:0%
to give it that boost in acceleration
 

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.169 align:start position:0%
to give it that boost in acceleration
that<00:12:08.709><c> had</c><00:12:08.829><c> been</c><00:12:09.009><c> seen</c><00:12:09.189><c> and</c><00:12:09.399><c> so</c><00:12:09.610><c> they</c><00:12:09.730><c> said</c><00:12:09.910><c> yes</c>

00:12:10.169 --> 00:12:10.179 align:start position:0%
that had been seen and so they said yes
 

00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:11.549 align:start position:0%
that had been seen and so they said yes
it<00:12:10.420><c> would</c><00:12:10.540><c> have</c><00:12:10.689><c> enough</c><00:12:10.870><c> energy</c><00:12:11.079><c> but</c><00:12:11.470><c> the</c>

00:12:11.549 --> 00:12:11.559 align:start position:0%
it would have enough energy but the
 

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:13.230 align:start position:0%
it would have enough energy but the

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%

00:12:29.429 --> 00:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
a Momo is not from our solar system so
 

00:12:29.439 --> 00:12:30.989 align:start position:0%
a Momo is not from our solar system so
maybe<00:12:29.679><c> it</c><00:12:29.829><c> doesn't</c><00:12:30.220><c> maybe</c><00:12:30.370><c> that's</c><00:12:30.639><c> why</c><00:12:30.790><c> we've</c>

00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:30.999 align:start position:0%
maybe it doesn't maybe that's why we've
 

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:33.150 align:start position:0%
maybe it doesn't maybe that's why we've

00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
think that it's sort of really long and

think that it's sort of really long and

maybe<00:12:37.209><c> it's</c><00:12:37.360><c> because</c><00:12:37.449><c> it's</c><00:12:37.660><c> nothing</c><00:12:38.230><c> like</c>

00:12:38.369 --> 00:12:38.379 align:start position:0%

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:00.690 align:start position:0%
