up<00:08:44.080><c> quickly</c><00:08:44.320><c> because</c><00:08:44.480><c> then</c><00:08:44.720><c> i</c><00:08:44.800><c> think</c><00:08:45.040><c> what</c>

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
up quickly because then i think what
 

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.310 align:start position:0%
up quickly because then i think what
she's<00:08:45.440><c> talking</c><00:08:45.760><c> about</c>

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
she's talking about
 

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.910 align:start position:0%
she's talking about
is<00:08:46.480><c> that</c><00:08:46.959><c> if</c><00:08:47.120><c> they've</c><00:08:47.360><c> multiplied</c><00:08:47.839><c> that</c>

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
is that if they've multiplied that
 

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.990 align:start position:0%
is that if they've multiplied that
frequency<00:08:48.399><c> by</c><00:08:48.720><c> pi</c><00:08:49.279><c> it</c><00:08:49.440><c> would</c><00:08:49.600><c> show</c><00:08:49.760><c> that</c><00:08:49.920><c> it's</c>

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
frequency by pi it would show that it's
 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.910 align:start position:0%
frequency by pi it would show that it's

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
that it's
 

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.070 align:start position:0%
that it's

actually like something that's
 

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.630 align:start position:0%
actually like something that's
intelligent<00:08:55.040><c> life</c><00:08:55.360><c> so</c>

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
intelligent life so
 

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.590 align:start position:0%
intelligent life so
yeah<00:08:56.800><c> the</c><00:08:56.959><c> drawing</c><00:08:57.200><c> center</c><00:08:57.440><c> meter</c><00:08:57.680><c> line</c><00:08:58.080><c> is</c>

00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
yeah the drawing center meter line is
 

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.269 align:start position:0%
yeah the drawing center meter line is
1420<00:08:59.600><c> megahertz</c><00:09:00.160><c> if</c><00:09:00.320><c> you</c><00:09:00.399><c> times</c><00:09:00.640><c> that</c><00:09:00.800><c> by</c><00:09:01.040><c> pi</c>

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
1420 megahertz if you times that by pi
 

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:02.710 align:start position:0%
1420 megahertz if you times that by pi
which<00:09:01.519><c> is</c><00:09:01.680><c> roughly</c><00:09:02.160><c> three</c><00:09:02.399><c> ish</c><00:09:02.560><c> you're</c><00:09:02.640><c> going</c>

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
which is roughly three ish you're going
 

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.310 align:start position:0%
which is roughly three ish you're going
to<00:09:02.800><c> get</c><00:09:02.959><c> something</c><00:09:03.200><c> around</c><00:09:03.440><c> 4.4</c><00:09:04.080><c> so</c><00:09:04.160><c> yeah</c>

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
to get something around 4.4 so yeah
 

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.509 align:start position:0%
to get something around 4.4 so yeah
they've<00:09:04.560><c> multiplied</c>

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
they've multiplied
 

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.670 align:start position:0%
they've multiplied

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
the 21 centimeter hydrogen emission line
 

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.870 align:start position:0%
the 21 centimeter hydrogen emission line
that<00:09:07.920><c> is</c><00:09:08.000><c> like</c><00:09:08.160><c> a</c><00:09:08.240><c> naturally</c><00:09:08.560><c> occurring</c>

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
that is like a naturally occurring
 

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.829 align:start position:0%
that is like a naturally occurring

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:11.910 align:start position:0%
phenomenon that

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
everyone who you know has technology
 

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.030 align:start position:0%
everyone who you know has technology
that<00:09:12.000><c> would</c><00:09:12.160><c> allow</c><00:09:12.320><c> them</c><00:09:12.480><c> to</c><00:09:12.640><c> detect</c><00:09:12.959><c> the</c>

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to detect the
 

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.790 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to detect the

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
signal would have also detected the 21
 

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.910 align:start position:0%
signal would have also detected the 21

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
centimeter line
 

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.750 align:start position:0%

and<00:09:16.000><c> so</c><00:09:16.240><c> timing</c><00:09:16.560><c> it</c><00:09:16.640><c> by</c><00:09:16.800><c> pi</c><00:09:17.200><c> shows</c><00:09:17.440><c> them</c><00:09:17.600><c> that</c>

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so timing it by pi shows them that
 

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.030 align:start position:0%
and so timing it by pi shows them that
it's<00:09:18.160><c> probably</c><00:09:18.720><c> not</c>

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's probably not

it's probably not

it doesn't make any sense the system is
 

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.870 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense the system is
