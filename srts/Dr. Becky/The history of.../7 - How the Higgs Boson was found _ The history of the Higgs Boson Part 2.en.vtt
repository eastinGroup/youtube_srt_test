Higgs came out with another paper and
 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.210 align:start position:0%
Higgs came out with another paper and

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
said that if this Higgs field is real
 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.830 align:start position:0%
said that if this Higgs field is real
and<00:01:56.490><c> that</c><00:01:56.520><c> is</c><00:01:56.700><c> the</c><00:01:56.820><c> real</c><00:01:57.030><c> mechanism</c><00:01:57.299><c> that</c>

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
and that is the real mechanism that
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260 align:start position:0%
and that is the real mechanism that

gives these fundamental particles mass
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.710 align:start position:0%
gives these fundamental particles mass
then<00:02:01.020><c> there</c><00:02:01.229><c> should</c><00:02:01.530><c> be</c><00:02:01.770><c> what's</c><00:02:02.100><c> called</c><00:02:02.400><c> a</c>

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
then there should be what's called a
 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.539 align:start position:0%
then there should be what's called a
boson<00:02:03.720><c> that</c><00:02:03.830><c> communicates</c><00:02:04.830><c> that</c><00:02:04.979><c> information</c>

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 align:start position:0%
boson that communicates that information
 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.210 align:start position:0%
boson that communicates that information
to<00:02:05.790><c> us</c><00:02:05.820><c> so</c><00:02:06.420><c> a</c><00:02:06.450><c> boson</c><00:02:07.049><c> is</c><00:02:07.229><c> anything</c><00:02:08.070><c> that</c>

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
to us so a boson is anything that
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.770 align:start position:0%
to us so a boson is anything that
communicates<00:02:08.670><c> information</c><00:02:08.910><c> about</c><00:02:09.420><c> a</c><00:02:09.450><c> field</c>

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
communicates information about a field
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.670 align:start position:0%
communicates information about a field
so<00:02:10.200><c> a</c><00:02:10.470><c> photon</c><00:02:11.400><c> of</c><00:02:11.610><c> light</c><00:02:11.700><c> is</c><00:02:12.420><c> a</c><00:02:12.750><c> boson</c><00:02:13.350><c> because</c>

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
so a photon of light is a boson because
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
so a photon of light is a boson because
it<00:02:13.799><c> communicates</c><00:02:13.980><c> something</c><00:02:14.579><c> to</c><00:02:14.940><c> us</c><00:02:15.090><c> about</c>

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 align:start position:0%
it communicates something to us about
 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.340 align:start position:0%
it communicates something to us about

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 align:start position:0%
the electro magnetic field and so in
 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.550 align:start position:0%
the electro magnetic field and so in
1966<00:02:20.340><c> Peter</c><00:02:20.730><c> Higgs</c><00:02:20.880><c> suggested</c><00:02:21.540><c> that</c><00:02:21.750><c> maybe</c><00:02:22.170><c> if</c>

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
1966 Peter Higgs suggested that maybe if
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.229 align:start position:0%
1966 Peter Higgs suggested that maybe if

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
got to sit down and chat with a load of
 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
got to sit down and chat with a load of
particle<00:03:14.950><c> physicists</c><00:03:15.519><c> and</c><00:03:15.790><c> you</c><00:03:16.060><c> bet</c><00:03:16.269><c> I</c><00:03:16.299><c> asked</c>

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 align:start position:0%
particle physicists and you bet I asked
 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.809 align:start position:0%
particle physicists and you bet I asked
them<00:03:16.810><c> this</c><00:03:17.049><c> question</c><00:03:17.260><c> so</c><00:03:17.920><c> everything</c><00:03:18.489><c> we</c><00:03:18.639><c> do</c>

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 align:start position:0%
them this question so everything we do
 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.750 align:start position:0%
them this question so everything we do
here<00:03:18.970><c> at</c><00:03:19.090><c> CERN</c><00:03:19.329><c> happens</c><00:03:19.959><c> around</c><00:03:20.920><c> us</c><00:03:21.069><c> anyway</c><00:03:21.549><c> so</c>

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
here at CERN happens around us anyway so
 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
here at CERN happens around us anyway so
cosmic<00:03:22.569><c> rays</c><00:03:22.750><c> that</c><00:03:22.780><c> come</c><00:03:23.319><c> into</c><00:03:23.470><c> our</c>

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.110 align:start position:0%
atmosphere create these kind of particle
collisions<00:03:26.379><c> and</c><00:03:26.739><c> so</c><00:03:27.310><c> Higgs</c><00:03:27.519><c> bosons</c><00:03:27.909><c> are</c>

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 align:start position:0%

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.569 align:start position:0%
collisions and so Higgs bosons are

00:25:10.229 --> 00:25:10.239 align:start position:0%

this case to other channels because just
 

00:25:13.419 --> 00:25:15.749 align:start position:0%
this case to other channels because just
because<00:25:13.570><c> it</c><00:25:14.109><c> decayed</c><00:25:14.739><c> so</c><00:25:15.340><c> the</c><00:25:15.429><c> Higgs</c><00:25:15.580><c> boson</c>

00:25:15.749 --> 00:25:15.759 align:start position:0%
because it decayed so the Higgs boson
 

00:25:15.759 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
because it decayed so the Higgs boson
gives<00:25:16.090><c> some</c><00:25:16.330><c> mass</c><00:25:17.049><c> to</c><00:25:17.320><c> vector</c><00:25:18.009><c> bosons</c><00:25:18.369><c> the</c><00:25:18.669><c> W</c>

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:18.970 align:start position:0%
gives some mass to vector bosons the W
 

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.139 align:start position:0%

00:25:21.139 --> 00:25:21.149 align:start position:0%

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:04.710 align:start position:0%
Higgs it was predicted so we knew that

it

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.660 align:start position:0%

so<00:27:13.080><c> particle</c><00:27:13.650><c> physics</c><00:27:14.010><c> is</c><00:27:14.220><c> doing</c><00:27:14.520><c> all</c><00:27:14.640><c> right</c>

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:14.670 align:start position:0%
so particle physics is doing all right
 

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.490 align:start position:0%
so particle physics is doing all right
we've<00:27:15.270><c> got</c><00:27:15.300><c> this</c><00:27:15.450><c> wonderful</c><00:27:15.630><c> model</c><00:27:16.020><c> but</c><00:27:16.320><c> we've</c>

we've got this wonderful model but we've

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.860 align:start position:0%
 
there's<00:27:23.880><c> room</c><00:27:24.090><c> for</c><00:27:24.120><c> improvement</c><00:27:24.690><c> and</c><00:27:24.720><c> we're</c>

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:24.870 align:start position:0%
there's room for improvement and we're
 

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.390 align:start position:0%
there's room for improvement and we're
also<00:27:24.990><c> missing</c><00:27:25.170><c> a</c><00:27:25.320><c> fundamental</c><00:27:25.740><c> force</c><00:27:25.860><c> gravity</c>

so<00:27:26.460><c> you</c><00:27:26.640><c> know</c><00:27:26.930><c> there's</c><00:27:27.930><c> work</c><00:27:28.080><c> to</c><00:27:28.140><c> do</c>

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:28.590 align:start position:0%
so you know there's work to do
 

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
so you know there's work to do
ok<00:27:28.860><c> this</c><00:27:29.190><c> how</c><00:27:29.340><c> the</c><00:27:29.400><c> model</c><00:27:29.670><c> is</c><00:27:29.700><c> not</c><00:27:29.880><c> complete</c><00:27:30.180><c> um</c>

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:30.930 align:start position:0%
ok this how the model is not complete um
 

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
ok this how the model is not complete um
so<00:27:31.410><c> we</c><00:27:31.590><c> think</c><00:27:31.770><c> there's</c><00:27:31.950><c> new</c><00:27:32.070><c> physics</c><00:27:32.370><c> out</c>

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:32.490 align:start position:0%
so we think there's new physics out
 

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.100 align:start position:0%
so we think there's new physics out
there<00:27:32.670><c> and</c><00:27:32.820><c> we're</c><00:27:33.570><c> wimps</c>

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:34.110 align:start position:0%

should like like that matter this is the
so<00:27:47.250><c> now</c><00:27:47.490><c> we</c><00:27:47.550><c> can</c><00:27:47.760><c> now</c><00:27:48.000><c> we</c><00:27:48.030><c> know</c><00:27:48.210><c> exactly</c><00:27:48.360><c> where</c>

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:48.540 align:start position:0%

so now we can now we know exactly where
to<00:27:48.600><c> look</c><00:27:48.780><c> for</c><00:27:48.900><c> the</c><00:27:48.990><c> Higgs</c><00:27:49.110><c> boson</c><00:27:49.260><c> we</c><00:27:49.800><c> can</c><00:27:49.920><c> start</c>

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:50.130 align:start position:0%
to look for the Higgs boson we can start
 

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.710 align:start position:0%
to look for the Higgs boson we can start
seeing<00:27:50.340><c> it</c><00:27:50.460><c> is</c><00:27:50.640><c> it</c><00:27:50.820><c> decay</c><00:27:51.060><c> into</c><00:27:51.180><c> something</c><00:27:51.600><c> is</c>

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
seeing it is it decay into something is
 

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.190 align:start position:0%
seeing it is it decay into something is
it<00:27:51.900><c> decay</c><00:27:52.140><c> into</c><00:27:52.260><c> dark</c><00:27:52.500><c> matter</c><00:27:53.150><c> and</c><00:27:54.150><c> yeah</c><00:27:54.690><c> this</c>

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
it decay into dark matter and yeah this
 

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.300 align:start position:0%
it decay into dark matter and yeah this
is<00:27:55.320><c> quite</c><00:27:55.470><c> challenging</c><00:27:55.680><c> because</c><00:27:55.920><c> we</c><00:27:56.040><c> can't</c>

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:56.310 align:start position:0%
is quite challenging because we can't
 

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
is quite challenging because we can't
see<00:27:56.460><c> dark</c><00:27:56.640><c> matter</c><00:27:56.850><c> so</c><00:27:57.360><c> we</c><00:27:57.480><c> have</c><00:27:57.570><c> it's</c><00:27:57.840><c> Higgs</c><00:27:58.050><c> to</c>

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:58.170 align:start position:0%
see dark matter so we have it's Higgs to
 

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:01.580 align:start position:0%
see dark matter so we have it's Higgs to
invisible<00:27:59.810><c> somewhat</c><00:28:00.810><c> think</c><00:28:01.020><c> think</c><00:28:01.260><c> we</c><00:28:01.350><c> need</c>

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:01.590 align:start position:0%
invisible somewhat think think we need
 

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.500 align:start position:0%
invisible somewhat think think we need
is<00:28:01.800><c> we</c><00:28:01.950><c> need</c><00:28:01.980><c> data</c><00:28:02.280><c> we</c><00:28:02.520><c> need</c><00:28:02.640><c> number</c><00:28:03.150><c> of</c><00:28:03.210><c> hexes</c>

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:03.510 align:start position:0%
is we need data we need number of hexes
 

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.870 align:start position:0%
is we need data we need number of hexes
so<00:28:03.750><c> Higgs</c><00:28:03.960><c> decays</c><00:28:04.140><c> need</c><00:28:05.040><c> these</c><00:28:05.430><c> decays</c><00:28:05.700><c> we're</c>

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
so Higgs decays need these decays we're
 

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
so Higgs decays need these decays we're
looking<00:28:06.060><c> at</c><00:28:06.150><c> are</c><00:28:06.240><c> rare</c><00:28:06.480><c> I</c><00:28:06.690><c> mean</c><00:28:06.900><c> you're</c><00:28:07.170><c> a</c><00:28:07.200><c> lot</c>

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:07.410 align:start position:0%
