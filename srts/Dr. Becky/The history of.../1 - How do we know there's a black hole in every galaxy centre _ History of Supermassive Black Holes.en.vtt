00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.560 align:start position:0%

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 align:start position:0%
to come together for us to understand
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.229 align:start position:0%
to come together for us to understand
something<00:00:48.899><c> so</c><00:00:49.110><c> I</c><00:00:49.680><c> figure</c><00:00:50.340><c> it's</c><00:00:50.579><c> about</c><00:00:50.640><c> time</c><00:00:50.820><c> we</c>

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
something so I figure it's about time we
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
something so I figure it's about time we
change<00:00:51.480><c> that</c>

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 align:start position:0%
change that
 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.849 align:start position:0%
change that
so<00:00:54.010><c> our</c><00:00:54.129><c> story</c><00:00:54.339><c> starts</c><00:00:54.850><c> in</c><00:00:55.179><c> 1909</c><00:00:56.140><c> the</c><00:00:56.769><c> guy</c>

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 align:start position:0%

ie<00:05:53.650><c> understanding</c><00:05:54.640><c> how</c><00:05:55.450><c> the</c><00:05:56.080><c> universe</c><00:05:56.110><c> came</c>

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 align:start position:0%
ie understanding how the universe came
 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.530 align:start position:0%
ie understanding how the universe came
to<00:05:56.830><c> be</c><00:05:56.950><c> and</c><00:05:57.280><c> what</c><00:05:57.700><c> had</c><00:05:57.790><c> happened</c><00:05:57.820><c> to</c><00:05:58.180><c> it</c><00:05:58.270><c> since</c>

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 align:start position:0%
to be and what had happened to it since
 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
to be and what had happened to it since
then<00:05:58.780><c> and</c><00:05:59.050><c> so</c><00:05:59.590><c> friedman</c><00:06:00.220><c> Walker</c><00:06:00.640><c> and</c><00:06:01.030><c> LaMotta</c>

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 align:start position:0%
then and so friedman Walker and LaMotta
 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.510 align:start position:0%
then and so friedman Walker and LaMotta
all<00:06:01.780><c> showed</c><00:06:02.260><c> that</c><00:06:02.650><c> if</c><00:06:02.770><c> he</c><00:06:02.830><c> took</c><00:06:03.010><c> Einstein's</c>

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
all showed that if he took Einstein's
 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.550 align:start position:0%

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 align:start position:0%
show that the universe was expanding now
 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.290 align:start position:0%
show that the universe was expanding now

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 align:start position:0%
that the universe was static and so
 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.350 align:start position:0%
