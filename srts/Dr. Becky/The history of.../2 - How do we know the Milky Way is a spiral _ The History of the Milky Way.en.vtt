the Milky Way could have one of these

the Milky Way could have one of these

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.050 align:start position:0%

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:30.770 align:start position:0%
in the bar as well and so there was a
 

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.500 align:start position:0%
in the bar as well and so there was a
