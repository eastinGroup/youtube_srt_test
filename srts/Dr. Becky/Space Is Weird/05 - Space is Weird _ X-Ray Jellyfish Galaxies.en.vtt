the<00:03:00.610><c> problem</c><00:03:00.880><c> is</c><00:03:00.940><c> if</c><00:03:01.090><c> you</c><00:03:01.300><c> decelerate</c><00:03:01.750><c> an</c>

the problem is if you decelerate an

the problem is if you decelerate an

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 align:start position:0%
electron then you reduce its energy and
 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.729 align:start position:0%
electron then you reduce its energy and
so<00:03:04.120><c> that</c><00:03:04.239><c> energy</c><00:03:04.390><c> has</c><00:03:04.690><c> to</c><00:03:04.750><c> go</c><00:03:04.900><c> somewhere</c><00:03:05.110><c> and</c>

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 align:start position:0%
so that energy has to go somewhere and
 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
so that energy has to go somewhere and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 align:start position:0%
in this case it's given out as x-ray
 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
in this case it's given out as x-ray

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 align:start position:0%

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 align:start position:0%
pressure of it pushing the gas down and
 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.970 align:start position:0%
pressure of it pushing the gas down and
so<00:04:48.120><c> you</c><00:04:48.180><c> do</c><00:04:48.540><c> end</c><00:04:48.690><c> up</c><00:04:48.840><c> compressing</c><00:04:49.530><c> some</c><00:04:49.770><c> of</c><00:04:49.890><c> the</c>

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
so you do end up compressing some of the
 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.330 align:start position:0%
so you do end up compressing some of the

the galaxy that actually end up forming
