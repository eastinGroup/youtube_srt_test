about rotation speeds of galaxies and it
 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
about rotation speeds of galaxies and it
just<00:01:05.830><c> made</c><00:01:05.950><c> me</c><00:01:06.040><c> think</c><00:01:06.250><c> like</c><00:01:06.360><c> what</c><00:01:07.360><c> is</c><00:01:07.479><c> the</c>

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 align:start position:0%
just made me think like what is the
 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
just made me think like what is the
fastest<00:01:08.110><c> to</c><00:01:08.260><c> spiral</c><00:01:08.590><c> galaxies</c><00:01:08.920><c> can</c><00:01:09.010><c> rotate</c><00:01:09.220><c> so</c>

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 align:start position:0%
fastest to spiral galaxies can rotate so
 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.800 align:start position:0%

I<00:01:09.520><c> was</c><00:01:09.640><c> trying</c><00:01:09.760><c> to</c><00:01:09.880><c> like</c><00:01:09.970><c> compare</c><00:01:10.360><c> it</c><00:01:10.540><c> to</c><00:01:10.690><c> sort</c>

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 align:start position:0%
I was trying to like compare it to sort
 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
I was trying to like compare it to sort
of<00:01:10.900><c> you</c><00:01:10.990><c> know</c><00:01:11.050><c> how</c><00:01:11.140><c> big</c><00:01:11.440><c> how</c><00:01:11.650><c> small</c><00:01:11.680><c> a</c><00:01:11.950><c> fee</c><00:01:12.250><c> is</c>

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 align:start position:0%
of you know how big how small a fee is
 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
of you know how big how small a fee is
and<00:01:12.610><c> so</c><00:01:12.760><c> I</c><00:01:12.790><c> ended</c><00:01:13.030><c> up</c><00:01:13.150><c> in</c><00:01:13.300><c> this</c><00:01:13.420><c> little</c><00:01:13.600><c> bit</c><00:01:13.780><c> on</c>

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 align:start position:0%
and so I ended up in this little bit on
 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
and so I ended up in this little bit on

galaxy you see it falling off so we

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 align:start position:0%
so there's much more mass in the center
 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.470 align:start position:0%
so there's much more mass in the center

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 align:start position:0%
something that was sort of like and yeah
 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.180 align:start position:0%
something that was sort of like and yeah
I<00:06:05.780><c> guess</c><00:06:05.900><c> we</c><00:06:06.260><c> should</c><00:06:06.440><c> look</c><00:06:06.560><c> at</c><00:06:06.710><c> that</c><00:06:06.860><c> and</c><00:06:07.040><c> make</c>

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 align:start position:0%
I guess we should look at that and make
 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.070 align:start position:0%
I guess we should look at that and make

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 align:start position:0%

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
sure that our assumption is correct to
something<00:06:09.440><c> that's</c><00:06:09.590><c> like</c><00:06:09.770><c> we</c><00:06:10.310><c> can't</c><00:06:10.580><c> currently</c>

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
something that's like we can't currently
 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.940 align:start position:0%
something that's like we can't currently
explain<00:06:11.419><c> it</c><00:06:11.600><c> so</c><00:06:12.020><c> this</c><00:06:12.169><c> then</c><00:06:12.380><c> brings</c><00:06:12.590><c> us</c><00:06:12.770><c> back</c>

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 align:start position:0%
explain it so this then brings us back
 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.050 align:start position:0%
explain it so this then brings us back
to<00:06:13.160><c> like</c><00:06:13.750><c> 1986</c><00:06:14.750><c> and</c><00:06:15.110><c> UGC</c><00:06:16.100><c> one</c><00:06:16.430><c> two</c><00:06:16.729><c> five</c><00:06:17.000><c> nine</c>

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.420 align:start position:0%
anyway and so you know what I think I'm
gonna<00:06:28.700><c> double</c><00:06:29.240><c> the</c><00:06:29.419><c> minogue</c><00:06:30.430><c> galaxies</c>

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 align:start position:0%
gonna double the minogue galaxies
 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.290 align:start position:0%
gonna double the minogue galaxies
because<00:06:31.970><c> you</c><00:06:32.510><c> know</c><00:06:32.630><c> what</c><00:06:32.840><c> like</c><00:06:33.320><c> Kylie</c><00:06:34.039><c> it's</c>

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
get very well was the mass of the galaxy
 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
get very well was the mass of the galaxy

from the rotation curve asked me how

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 align:start position:0%
much mass had to be in those areas and
 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.350 align:start position:0%
much mass had to be in those areas and
then<00:06:59.350><c> compare</c><00:06:59.710><c> it</c><00:06:59.740><c> to</c><00:06:59.920><c> how</c><00:07:00.640><c> much</c><00:07:00.880><c> mass</c><00:07:01.150><c> they</c>

00:14:06.619 --> 00:14:06.629 align:start position:0%
is energy output from the region around

00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:10.589 align:start position:0%
