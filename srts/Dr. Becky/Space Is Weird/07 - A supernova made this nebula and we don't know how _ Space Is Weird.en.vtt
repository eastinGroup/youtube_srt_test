00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
planets it's a bit of a misnomer from
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.110 align:start position:0%
planets it's a bit of a misnomer from
astronomical<00:00:41.100><c> history</c><00:00:41.730><c> you</c><00:00:41.820><c> know</c><00:00:41.940><c> and</c><00:00:42.059><c> they</c>

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
astronomical history you know and they
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
astronomical history you know and they
were<00:00:42.210><c> first</c><00:00:42.420><c> observed</c><00:00:42.629><c> back</c><00:00:43.140><c> in</c><00:00:43.260><c> sort</c><00:00:43.410><c> of</c><00:00:43.440><c> like</c>

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 align:start position:0%
were first observed back in sort of like
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.190 align:start position:0%
were first observed back in sort of like
the<00:00:43.680><c> eighteen</c><00:00:44.129><c> hundred's</c><00:00:45.090><c> they</c><00:00:45.329><c> were</c><00:00:45.870><c> mostly</c>

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
the eighteen hundred's they were mostly
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.049 align:start position:0%
the eighteen hundred's they were mostly
round<00:00:46.559><c> and</c><00:00:46.920><c> they</c><00:00:46.980><c> had</c><00:00:47.129><c> kind</c><00:00:47.370><c> of</c><00:00:47.399><c> rings</c><00:00:47.730><c> so</c>

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 align:start position:0%
round and they had kind of rings so
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.940 align:start position:0%
round and they had kind of rings so
people<00:00:48.300><c> thought</c><00:00:48.420><c> they</c><00:00:48.570><c> looked</c><00:00:48.780><c> like</c><00:00:49.079><c> a</c><00:00:49.379><c> planet</c>

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 align:start position:0%
people thought they looked like a planet
 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 align:start position:0%
people thought they looked like a planet
in<00:00:50.100><c> a</c><00:00:50.190><c> way</c><00:00:50.219><c> and</c><00:00:50.820><c> so</c><00:00:51.239><c> they</c><00:00:51.510><c> got</c><00:00:51.690><c> dubbed</c>

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
in a way and so they got dubbed
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
in a way and so they got dubbed

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
William Herschel to blame for that and
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 align:start position:0%
William Herschel to blame for that and
what<00:00:56.820><c> they</c><00:00:56.910><c> are</c><00:00:56.940><c> instead</c><00:00:57.239><c> is</c><00:00:57.870><c> the</c><00:00:58.320><c> outer</c>

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
what they are instead is the outer
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.860 align:start position:0%
what they are instead is the outer
layers<00:00:58.949><c> of</c><00:00:59.039><c> a</c><00:00:59.280><c> star</c><00:00:59.309><c> that's</c><00:00:59.789><c> been</c><00:00:59.969><c> thrown</c><00:01:00.510><c> off</c>

layers of a star that's been thrown off
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.900 align:start position:0%

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 align:start position:0%
at the end of its lifetime so a star
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.340 align:start position:0%
at the end of its lifetime so a star
that's<00:01:03.149><c> not</c><00:01:03.449><c> really</c><00:01:03.809><c> big</c><00:01:03.989><c> enough</c><00:01:04.019><c> to</c><00:01:04.229><c> go</c>

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 align:start position:0%
that's not really big enough to go
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.620 align:start position:0%
that's not really big enough to go
supernova<00:01:04.860><c> something</c><00:01:05.640><c> like</c><00:01:05.909><c> the</c><00:01:06.240><c> Sun</c><00:01:06.479><c> and</c>

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 align:start position:0%
supernova something like the Sun and
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.929 align:start position:0%
supernova something like the Sun and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 align:start position:0%
maybe lower masses as well where they
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.510 align:start position:0%
maybe lower masses as well where they

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
expand what we call a red giant phase
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.070 align:start position:0%
expand what we call a red giant phase
and<00:01:12.180><c> then</c><00:01:12.390><c> once</c><00:01:12.540><c> they've</c><00:01:12.689><c> gone</c><00:01:12.810><c> through</c><00:01:12.990><c> that</c>

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
have expanded into this giant ring and
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.700 align:start position:0%
have expanded into this giant ring and

call a hot Jupiter so a planet that is

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:20.510 align:start position:0%
Jupiter in the solar system does and
 

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.319 align:start position:0%
Jupiter in the solar system does and
actually<00:10:21.050><c> orbits</c><00:10:21.709><c> very</c><00:10:21.829><c> very</c><00:10:22.399><c> close</c><00:10:22.940><c> to</c><00:10:23.209><c> its</c>

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:23.329 align:start position:0%
actually orbits very very close to its
 

00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:25.269 align:start position:0%
actually orbits very very close to its
star<00:10:23.450><c> and</c><00:10:23.899><c> so</c><00:10:24.020><c> it's</c><00:10:24.170><c> a</c><00:10:24.230><c> very</c><00:10:24.440><c> very</c><00:10:24.589><c> hot</c><00:10:24.950><c> planet</c>

00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
star and so it's a very very hot planet
 

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:27.340 align:start position:0%
star and so it's a very very hot planet
so<00:10:25.610><c> if</c><00:10:25.850><c> it</c><00:10:26.029><c> was</c><00:10:26.149><c> orbiting</c><00:10:26.450><c> that</c><00:10:26.779><c> close</c><00:10:27.050><c> then</c>

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:27.350 align:start position:0%
so if it was orbiting that close then
 

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.380 align:start position:0%
so if it was orbiting that close then
yeah<00:10:27.709><c> it</c><00:10:27.890><c> would</c><00:10:27.920><c> have</c><00:10:28.250><c> been</c><00:10:28.430><c> affected</c><00:10:28.970><c> by</c><00:10:29.329><c> this</c>

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:29.390 align:start position:0%
yeah it would have been affected by this
 

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.530 align:start position:0%
yeah it would have been affected by this
red<00:10:30.260><c> giant</c><00:10:30.680><c> phase</c><00:10:30.740><c> and</c><00:10:31.279><c> then</c><00:10:31.430><c> this</c><00:10:31.579><c> X</c><00:10:31.880><c> portion</c>

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:32.540 align:start position:0%
red giant phase and then this X portion
 

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.870 align:start position:0%
red giant phase and then this X portion
of<00:10:32.800><c> material</c><00:10:33.800><c> so</c><00:10:34.040><c> that</c><00:10:34.190><c> clearly</c><00:10:34.579><c> would</c><00:10:34.790><c> have</c>

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.850 align:start position:0%

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:36.860 align:start position:0%
affected the planet orbit and it would
 

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.100 align:start position:0%
affected the planet orbit and it would

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.110 align:start position:0%
have started falling in towards its star
 

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.860 align:start position:0%

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:41.870 align:start position:0%
and the energy in that process actually
 

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.810 align:start position:0%
and the energy in that process actually
