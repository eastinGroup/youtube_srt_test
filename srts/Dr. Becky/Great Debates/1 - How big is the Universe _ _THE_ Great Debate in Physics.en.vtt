so because these globular clusters have

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
just like andromeda and it indeed was
 

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.470 align:start position:0%

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:44.069 align:start position:0%

just<00:14:41.760><c> like</c><00:14:42.000><c> shapley</c><00:14:42.480><c> had</c><00:14:42.639><c> measured</c><00:14:43.199><c> back</c><00:14:43.680><c> in</c>

00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
just like shapley had measured back in
 

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:45.030 align:start position:0%
just like shapley had measured back in
1920.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
1920.
 

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.870 align:start position:0%

so<00:14:45.199><c> curtis</c><00:14:45.680><c> was</c><00:14:45.839><c> definitely</c><00:14:46.240><c> right</c><00:14:46.560><c> about</c><00:14:46.800><c> the</c>

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
so curtis was definitely right about the
 

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.790 align:start position:0%
so curtis was definitely right about the

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
own right these island universe theory
 

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.430 align:start position:0%
own right these island universe theory
and<00:14:51.040><c> so</c><00:14:51.199><c> it's</c><00:14:51.440><c> often</c><00:14:52.160><c> curtis</c><00:14:52.880><c> who's</c><00:14:53.120><c> sort</c><00:14:53.279><c> of</c>

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
