come<00:01:05.680><c> into</c><00:01:06.000><c> it</c><00:01:06.479><c> at</c><00:01:06.560><c> the</c><00:01:06.720><c> end</c><00:01:07.200><c> so</c><00:01:08.240><c> let's</c><00:01:08.479><c> just</c>

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
come into it at the end so let's just
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.830 align:start position:0%
come into it at the end so let's just
take<00:01:08.880><c> a</c><00:01:08.960><c> deep</c><00:01:09.200><c> breath</c>

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
take a deep breath
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.710 align:start position:0%
take a deep breath
and<00:01:10.240><c> dive</c><00:01:10.560><c> right</c><00:01:10.799><c> into</c><00:01:11.040><c> this</c>

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.510 align:start position:0%
