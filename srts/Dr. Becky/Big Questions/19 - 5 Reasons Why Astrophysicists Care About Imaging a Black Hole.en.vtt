2019<00:00:07.450><c> was</c><00:00:07.930><c> a</c><00:00:08.109><c> big</c><00:00:08.760><c> day</c><00:00:09.760><c> the</c><00:00:10.269><c> event</c><00:00:10.540><c> horizon</c>

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 align:start position:0%
2019 was a big day the event horizon
 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
2019 was a big day the event horizon

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 align:start position:0%
couple years now finally released their
 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.410 align:start position:0%
couple years now finally released their
long-awaited<00:00:16.059><c> image</c><00:00:16.630><c> of</c><00:00:16.870><c> a</c><00:00:17.650><c> black</c><00:00:18.400><c> hole</c><00:00:18.700><c> and</c>

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 align:start position:0%
long-awaited image of a black hole and
 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.210 align:start position:0%
long-awaited image of a black hole and
so<00:00:19.810><c> the</c><00:00:19.900><c> dust</c><00:00:20.109><c> has</c><00:00:20.320><c> had</c><00:00:20.470><c> a</c><00:00:20.500><c> little</c><00:00:20.740><c> bit</c><00:00:20.830><c> of</c><00:00:20.949><c> time</c>

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 align:start position:0%
so the dust has had a little bit of time
 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.370 align:start position:0%
so the dust has had a little bit of time
to<00:00:21.730><c> settle</c><00:00:22.000><c> after</c><00:00:22.449><c> a</c><00:00:22.480><c> bit</c><00:00:22.630><c> of</c><00:00:22.660><c> a</c><00:00:22.779><c> manic</c><00:00:23.170><c> week</c>

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 align:start position:0%
to settle after a bit of a manic week
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.509 align:start position:0%
to settle after a bit of a manic week
and<00:00:23.619><c> so</c><00:00:23.740><c> I</c><00:00:23.769><c> thought</c><00:00:24.039><c> it</c><00:00:24.099><c> would</c><00:00:24.279><c> be</c><00:00:24.369><c> a</c><00:00:24.400><c> really</c>

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 align:start position:0%
and so I thought it would be a really
 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
and so I thought it would be a really
great<00:00:24.640><c> time</c><00:00:24.880><c> now</c><00:00:25.060><c> to</c><00:00:25.119><c> reflect</c><00:00:25.539><c> on</c><00:00:25.779><c> the</c><00:00:26.140><c> reasons</c>

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 align:start position:0%
great time now to reflect on the reasons
 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
great time now to reflect on the reasons
why<00:00:26.800><c> we</c><00:00:27.070><c> actually</c><00:00:27.460><c> care</c><00:00:27.609><c> about</c><00:00:27.789><c> this</c><00:00:27.910><c> why</c><00:00:28.150><c> it's</c>

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 align:start position:0%
why we actually care about this why it's
 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.929 align:start position:0%
why we actually care about this why it's
not<00:00:28.630><c> just</c><00:00:28.900><c> a</c><00:00:29.740><c> pretty</c><00:00:30.369><c> picture</c>

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 align:start position:0%

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 align:start position:0%

an<00:02:08.050><c> accretion</c><00:02:08.440><c> disk</c><00:02:08.619><c> so</c><00:02:09.100><c> accretion</c><00:02:09.970><c> is</c><00:02:10.060><c> a</c><00:02:10.119><c> word</c>

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 align:start position:0%

that we use a lot in astrophysics it

basically means like collected under

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 align:start position:0%
spirals in towards the black hole then
 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
spirals in towards the black hole then
some<00:02:47.320><c> of</c><00:02:47.410><c> its</c><00:02:47.530><c> coming</c><00:02:47.710><c> towards</c><00:02:48.190><c> you</c><00:02:48.340><c> and</c><00:02:48.370><c> some</c>

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 align:start position:0%
some of its coming towards you and some
 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.310 align:start position:0%
some of its coming towards you and some

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
of it is moving away from you but then
 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.830 align:start position:0%
of it is moving away from you but then
also<00:02:50.620><c> the</c><00:02:51.400><c> light</c><00:02:51.640><c> that's</c><00:02:51.820><c> coming</c><00:02:52.180><c> from</c><00:02:52.390><c> behind</c>

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
also the light that's coming from behind
 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
also the light that's coming from behind
this<00:02:53.410><c> 3-dimensional</c><00:02:54.220><c> you</c><00:02:54.550><c> know</c><00:02:54.640><c> mass</c><00:02:55.030><c> of</c><00:02:55.240><c> the</c>

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 align:start position:0%
this 3-dimensional you know mass of the
 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.350 align:start position:0%
this 3-dimensional you know mass of the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
black hole there is gonna be absorbed as
 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.990 align:start position:0%
black hole there is gonna be absorbed as

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
well so you end up sort of with a bright
 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
well so you end up sort of with a bright

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 align:start position:0%
event horizon so the event horizon is

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
black hole that if you pass that point

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 align:start position:0%
then nothing is going to be able to get

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
see if there was a black hole there I've
 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.650 align:start position:0%
see if there was a black hole there I've
actually<00:03:42.250><c> turned</c><00:03:42.459><c> out</c><00:03:42.610><c> to</c><00:03:42.760><c> be</c><00:03:42.850><c> true</c><00:03:43.030><c> as</c><00:03:43.390><c> well</c>

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 align:start position:0%
actually turned out to be true as well
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.330 align:start position:0%
actually turned out to be true as well
so<00:03:44.230><c> the</c><00:03:44.350><c> second</c><00:03:44.680><c> reason</c><00:03:44.739><c> why</c><00:03:45.010><c> we</c><00:03:45.130><c> care</c><00:03:45.310><c> about</c>

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 align:start position:0%
so the second reason why we care about
 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.890 align:start position:0%
so the second reason why we care about
this<00:03:45.700><c> image</c><00:03:45.970><c> is</c><00:03:46.120><c> because</c><00:03:46.360><c> we</c><00:03:46.480><c> can</c><00:03:46.600><c> actually</c>

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 align:start position:0%
this image is because we can actually

this image is because we can actually

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 align:start position:0%
use it to test our theories of gravity
 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.259 align:start position:0%
use it to test our theories of gravity
so<00:03:50.590><c> Newton</c><00:03:51.430><c> came</c><00:03:51.610><c> up</c><00:03:51.730><c> with</c><00:03:51.820><c> a</c><00:03:51.880><c> theory</c><00:03:52.090><c> of</c>

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 align:start position:0%
so Newton came up with a theory of

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:54.580 align:start position:0%
with the magnetic field and so you've
 

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.730 align:start position:0%
with the magnetic field and so you've

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.140 align:start position:0%
so as it spins the magnetic field lines
 

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
so as it spins the magnetic field lines
around<00:09:02.560><c> that</c><00:09:02.650><c> black</c><00:09:02.770><c> hole</c><00:09:02.830><c> get</c><00:09:03.190><c> incredibly</c>

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:03.730 align:start position:0%
around that black hole get incredibly
 

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
around that black hole get incredibly

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.110 align:start position:0%
incredibly tangled because it's spinning
 

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.050 align:start position:0%

so<00:09:05.290><c> fast</c><00:09:05.490><c> then</c><00:09:06.490><c> you've</c><00:09:06.640><c> got</c><00:09:06.790><c> charged</c>

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.060 align:start position:0%
so fast then you've got charged
 

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.610 align:start position:0%
so fast then you've got charged
particles<00:09:07.720><c> that</c><00:09:07.839><c> are</c><00:09:07.990><c> then</c><00:09:08.080><c> gonna</c><00:09:08.230><c> follow</c>

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:08.620 align:start position:0%
particles that are then gonna follow
 

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.350 align:start position:0%
particles that are then gonna follow

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:23.330 align:start position:0%
