there's<00:02:46.720><c> two</c><00:02:47.040><c> questions</c><00:02:47.519><c> you</c><00:02:47.599><c> need</c><00:02:47.760><c> to</c><00:02:47.840><c> answer</c>

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
there's two questions you need to answer
 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.750 align:start position:0%
there's two questions you need to answer
right<00:02:48.400><c> the</c><00:02:48.560><c> first</c><00:02:48.800><c> one</c>

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
right the first one
 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.229 align:start position:0%
right the first one
is<00:02:50.000><c> it</c><00:02:50.160><c> actually</c><00:02:50.640><c> a</c><00:02:50.879><c> real</c><00:02:51.519><c> thing</c><00:02:51.840><c> that</c><00:02:52.000><c> you've</c>

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
is it actually a real thing that you've
 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.190 align:start position:0%
is it actually a real thing that you've
observed

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
observed
 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.309 align:start position:0%
observed
and<00:02:53.440><c> two</c><00:02:54.319><c> is</c><00:02:54.480><c> it</c><00:02:54.640><c> a</c><00:02:54.959><c> new</c><00:02:55.360><c> thing</c><00:02:55.920><c> that</c><00:02:56.080><c> you've</c>

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
and two is it a new thing that you've
 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.190 align:start position:0%
and two is it a new thing that you've

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 align:start position:0%

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.910 align:start position:0%

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
what is this new definitely so let's
 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.190 align:start position:0%
what is this new definitely so let's
start<00:03:00.080><c> with</c><00:03:00.239><c> that</c><00:03:00.400><c> first</c><00:03:00.640><c> one</c><00:03:00.879><c> trying</c><00:03:01.120><c> to</c>

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
start with that first one trying to
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.509 align:start position:0%
start with that first one trying to
determine<00:03:01.840><c> if</c><00:03:02.080><c> it</c><00:03:02.319><c> is</c><00:03:02.560><c> actually</c><00:03:02.879><c> real</c><00:03:03.200><c> so</c><00:03:03.360><c> what</c>

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 align:start position:0%
determine if it is actually real so what
 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.710 align:start position:0%
determine if it is actually real so what
do<00:03:03.599><c> i</c><00:03:03.680><c> actually</c><00:03:03.920><c> mean</c><00:03:04.159><c> by</c><00:03:04.400><c> this</c>

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
do i actually mean by this
 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.470 align:start position:0%
do i actually mean by this
well<00:03:05.280><c> you</c><00:03:05.440><c> have</c><00:03:05.519><c> to</c><00:03:05.599><c> work</c><00:03:05.840><c> out</c><00:03:06.000><c> whether</c><00:03:06.239><c> what</c>

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
well you have to work out whether what
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.149 align:start position:0%
well you have to work out whether what
you've<00:03:07.120><c> taken</c><00:03:07.440><c> an</c><00:03:07.599><c> image</c><00:03:07.920><c> of</c>

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
you've taken an image of
 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.070 align:start position:0%
you've taken an image of
is<00:03:08.400><c> actually</c><00:03:08.720><c> something</c><00:03:09.360><c> in</c><00:03:09.519><c> space</c><00:03:09.920><c> like</c><00:03:10.000><c> a</c>

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
is actually something in space like a

is actually something in space like a
