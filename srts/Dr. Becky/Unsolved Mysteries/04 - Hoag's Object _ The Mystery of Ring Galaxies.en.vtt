showed a video of it in the video and
 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.490 align:start position:0%
showed a video of it in the video and
there<00:00:21.600><c> were</c><00:00:21.660><c> all</c><00:00:21.779><c> these</c><00:00:21.930><c> comments</c><00:00:22.140><c> that</c><00:00:22.439><c> were</c>

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.060 align:start position:0%
like whoa like what is that
that<00:00:24.750><c> looks</c><00:00:24.930><c> amazing</c><00:00:25.050><c> tell</c><00:00:25.800><c> me</c><00:00:25.890><c> more</c><00:00:26.039><c> about</c>

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 align:start position:0%
that looks amazing tell me more about
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.519 align:start position:0%
that looks amazing tell me more about
that<00:00:26.340><c> and</c><00:00:27.300><c> it's</c><00:00:27.449><c> not</c><00:00:27.539><c> a</c><00:00:27.570><c> Messier</c><00:00:27.930><c> object</c><00:00:28.320><c> so</c><00:00:28.439><c> it</c>

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 align:start position:0%
that and it's not a Messier object so it
 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
that and it's not a Messier object so it
kind<00:00:28.830><c> of</c><00:00:29.070><c> falls</c><00:00:29.340><c> out</c><00:00:29.490><c> of</c><00:00:29.519><c> the</c><00:00:29.670><c> remit</c><00:00:29.970><c> of</c><00:00:30.000><c> these</c>

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
like two distinct parts right it's got
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.869 align:start position:0%

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
structure so they found that if you take

that central spherical component and
 

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.100 align:start position:0%
that central spherical component and
then<00:11:56.820><c> you</c><00:11:56.910><c> take</c><00:11:57.090><c> the</c><00:11:57.210><c> ring</c><00:11:57.390><c> around</c><00:11:57.600><c> it</c><00:11:57.960><c> as</c><00:11:58.080><c> well</c>

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:58.110 align:start position:0%
then you take the ring around it as well

then you take the ring around it as well

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
and you say where do the forces between
 

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:02.370 align:start position:0%
the two objects balance the

the two objects balance the

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:04.650 align:start position:0%

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:06.930 align:start position:0%
find that that is on the very inner part

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.460 align:start position:0%
they're disturbed and so they actually

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.090 align:start position:0%
