00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 align:start position:0%
it has to be someone from the other

it has to be someone from the other

that<00:03:46.230><c> will</c><00:03:46.380><c> mean</c><00:03:46.560><c> a</c><00:03:46.709><c> shook</c><00:03:47.310><c> hands</c><00:03:47.579><c> with</c><00:03:47.820><c> both</c>

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 align:start position:0%
that will mean a shook hands with both
 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.100 align:start position:0%
that will mean a shook hands with both

mr. and mrs. Lars consequently that
 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.590 align:start position:0%
mr. and mrs. Lars consequently that

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
would mean a prime has to be the person
 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.270 align:start position:0%
would mean a prime has to be the person

who answered 0 we can then conclude that

who answered 0 we can then conclude that

mrs. Lars is the one who answered 1 and
