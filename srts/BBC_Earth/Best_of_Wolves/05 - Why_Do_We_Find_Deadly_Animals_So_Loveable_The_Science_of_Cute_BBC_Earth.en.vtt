door it depends what we're feeding them
so<00:09:26.170><c> today</c><00:09:26.440><c> because</c><00:09:26.770><c> it's</c><00:09:26.950><c> quail</c><00:09:27.330><c> sometimes</c><00:09:28.330><c> we</c>

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
so today because it's quail sometimes we
 

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.790 align:start position:0%
so today because it's quail sometimes we
will<00:09:28.600><c> split</c><00:09:28.839><c> the</c><00:09:29.020><c> feed</c><00:09:29.200><c> up</c><00:09:29.380><c> throughout</c><00:09:29.650><c> the</c>

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
will split the feed up throughout the
 

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.410 align:start position:0%
will split the feed up throughout the
day<00:09:29.830><c> and</c><00:09:30.220><c> we're</c><00:09:30.550><c> gonna</c><00:09:30.640><c> put</c><00:09:30.850><c> all</c><00:09:30.970><c> of</c><00:09:31.000><c> this</c><00:09:31.180><c> out</c>

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:31.420 align:start position:0%
day and we're gonna put all of this out
 

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.820 align:start position:0%

now just so we can give them a nice big
 

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.250 align:start position:0%
now just so we can give them a nice big
scatter<00:09:33.430><c> feed</c><00:09:33.760><c> which</c><00:09:34.570><c> will</c><00:09:34.720><c> keep</c><00:09:34.810><c> them</c><00:09:34.930><c> nice</c>

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:35.260 align:start position:0%
scatter feed which will keep them nice
 

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.870 align:start position:0%

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:38.430 align:start position:0%
them a couple of times a day and
 

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
them a couple of times a day and
sometimes<00:09:39.430><c> will</c><00:09:39.970><c> feed</c><00:09:40.150><c> them</c><00:09:40.360><c> rabbit</c><00:09:40.780><c> or</c>

so<00:10:15.160><c> the</c><00:10:15.250><c> conservation</c><00:10:15.610><c> of</c><00:10:16.029><c> cheetahs</c><00:10:16.450><c> is</c>

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
so the conservation of cheetahs is
 

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.329 align:start position:0%
so the conservation of cheetahs is
really<00:10:17.019><c> really</c><00:10:17.200><c> important</c><00:10:17.709><c> now</c><00:10:17.860><c> isn't</c><00:10:18.220><c> it</c>

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:18.339 align:start position:0%
really really important now isn't it
 

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
really really important now isn't it
yeah<00:10:18.670><c> definitely</c><00:10:19.410><c> recent</c><00:10:20.410><c> estimates</c><00:10:20.920><c> of</c><00:10:21.070><c> the</c>

yeah definitely recent estimates of the
 

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah definitely recent estimates of the

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:22.810 align:start position:0%
numbers in the world are quite low
 

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
numbers in the world are quite low
they're<00:10:23.200><c> anywhere</c><00:10:23.440><c> between</c><00:10:23.740><c> 7,000</c><00:10:24.730><c> and</c>

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
they're anywhere between 7,000 and
 

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
they're anywhere between 7,000 and
10,000<00:10:25.420><c> which</c><00:10:26.290><c> is</c><00:10:26.440><c> really</c><00:10:26.680><c> not</c><00:10:26.830><c> a</c><00:10:26.860><c> huge</c><00:10:27.040><c> number</c>

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.250 align:start position:0%
10,000 which is really not a huge number
 

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.130 align:start position:0%
10,000 which is really not a huge number
at<00:10:27.459><c> all</c><00:10:27.579><c> so</c><00:10:27.910><c> it's</c><00:10:28.240><c> really</c><00:10:28.450><c> important</c><00:10:28.899><c> that</c><00:10:28.930><c> we</c>

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.140 align:start position:0%
at all so it's really important that we
 

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
at all so it's really important that we
try<00:10:29.470><c> and</c><00:10:29.589><c> look</c><00:10:29.649><c> after</c><00:10:29.829><c> them</c><00:10:30.100><c> as</c><00:10:30.310><c> best</c><00:10:30.550><c> as</c><00:10:30.670><c> we</c>
