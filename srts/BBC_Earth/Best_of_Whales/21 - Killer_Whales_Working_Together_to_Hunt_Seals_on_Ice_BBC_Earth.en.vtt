00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.020 align:start position:0%

to<00:02:02.649><c> be</c><00:02:02.740><c> able</c><00:02:02.860><c> to</c><00:02:02.950><c> keep</c><00:02:03.130><c> up</c><00:02:03.310><c> with</c><00:02:03.460><c> these</c><00:02:03.549><c> guys</c><00:02:03.759><c> is</c>

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 align:start position:0%
to be able to keep up with these guys is
 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.990 align:start position:0%
to be able to keep up with these guys is
if<00:02:04.210><c> we</c><00:02:04.360><c> could</c><00:02:04.540><c> get</c><00:02:04.750><c> a</c><00:02:04.960><c> satellite</c><00:02:05.530><c> tag</c><00:02:05.799><c> onto</c><00:02:06.159><c> one</c>

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
if we could get a satellite tag onto one
 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.569 align:start position:0%
if we could get a satellite tag onto one
of<00:02:07.119><c> the</c><00:02:07.270><c> members</c><00:02:07.719><c> of</c><00:02:07.750><c> the</c><00:02:08.110><c> family</c><00:02:08.290><c> group</c><00:02:08.579><c> it</c>

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.579 align:start position:0%
of the members of the family group it
 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:10.919 align:start position:0%
of the members of the family group it

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 align:start position:0%
attached on and that was fantastic
 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.470 align:start position:0%
attached on and that was fantastic
because<00:02:11.650><c> that</c><00:02:11.830><c> meant</c><00:02:12.129><c> then</c><00:02:12.580><c> we</c><00:02:12.790><c> had</c><00:02:12.970><c> this</c><00:02:13.150><c> link</c>

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
because that meant then we had this link
 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.210 align:start position:0%
because that meant then we had this link
with<00:02:13.780><c> this</c><00:02:13.930><c> family</c><00:02:14.230><c> grief</c><00:02:14.620><c> killer</c>

with this family grief killer
 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.750 align:start position:0%
with this family grief killer
and<00:02:15.850><c> we</c><00:02:16.090><c> could</c><00:02:16.330><c> follow</c><00:02:16.840><c> them</c><00:02:17.170><c> through</c><00:02:17.440><c> the</c><00:02:17.560><c> ice</c>

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we could follow them through the ice
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
and we could follow them through the ice
that<00:02:18.760><c> was</c><00:02:18.820><c> really</c><00:02:19.390><c> the</c><00:02:19.600><c> key</c><00:02:20.160><c> so</c><00:02:21.160><c> we</c><00:02:21.280><c> continued</c>

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 align:start position:0%
that was really the key so we continued
 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.820 align:start position:0%
that was really the key so we continued
south<00:02:22.390><c> to</c><00:02:22.780><c> get</c><00:02:22.960><c> to</c><00:02:23.140><c> the</c><00:02:23.260><c> place</c><00:02:23.440><c> where</c><00:02:23.680><c> there</c>

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 align:start position:0%
south to get to the place where there
 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.070 align:start position:0%
south to get to the place where there
was<00:02:23.920><c> a</c><00:02:24.040><c> potential</c><00:02:24.460><c> to</c><00:02:24.940><c> get</c><00:02:25.120><c> this</c><00:02:25.300><c> behavior</c><00:02:25.510><c> but</c>

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
was a potential to get this behavior but
 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.230 align:start position:0%
was a potential to get this behavior but
we<00:02:26.530><c> still</c><00:02:26.770><c> had</c><00:02:26.980><c> no</c><00:02:27.160><c> idea</c><00:02:27.190><c> we</c><00:02:27.820><c> were</c><00:02:27.910><c> actually</c>

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.530 align:start position:0%
gonna see it or if it really happened we

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 align:start position:0%
started following these guys and it was
