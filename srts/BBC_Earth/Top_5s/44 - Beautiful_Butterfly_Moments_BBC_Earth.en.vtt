we<00:10:08.240><c> got</c><00:10:08.480><c> it</c><00:10:08.959><c> what</c><00:10:09.200><c> frame</c><00:10:09.440><c> rate</c><00:10:09.680><c> was</c><00:10:09.839><c> this</c><00:10:10.000><c> one</c>

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
we got it what frame rate was this one
 

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.269 align:start position:0%
we got it what frame rate was this one
this<00:10:10.320><c> was</c><00:10:10.480><c> a</c><00:10:10.640><c> thousand</c>

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
this was a thousand
 

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.710 align:start position:0%
this was a thousand
so<00:10:11.440><c> what's</c><00:10:11.920><c> what's</c><00:10:12.160><c> happening</c><00:10:12.480><c> with</c><00:10:12.560><c> that</c>

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
so what's what's happening with that
 

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.949 align:start position:0%
so what's what's happening with that
abdomen<00:10:13.120><c> then</c><00:10:13.519><c> why</c><00:10:13.760><c> is</c><00:10:14.240><c> why</c><00:10:14.399><c> is</c><00:10:14.480><c> that</c>

00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
abdomen then why is why is that
 

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:16.389 align:start position:0%
abdomen then why is why is that
shaking<00:10:15.279><c> up</c><00:10:15.440><c> and</c><00:10:15.519><c> down</c><00:10:15.760><c> like</c><00:10:16.079><c> so</c><00:10:16.240><c> he's</c>

00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
shaking up and down like so he's
 

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:18.069 align:start position:0%
shaking up and down like so he's
bringing<00:10:16.640><c> it</c><00:10:16.720><c> up</c><00:10:16.800><c> there</c><00:10:17.200><c> yeah</c><00:10:17.760><c> well</c>

00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
bringing it up there yeah well

they<00:10:27.760><c> move</c><00:10:28.240><c> which</c><00:10:28.399><c> is</c><00:10:28.560><c> pretty</c><00:10:28.800><c> cool</c>

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
they move which is pretty cool
 

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.350 align:start position:0%
they move which is pretty cool
butterflies<00:10:30.079><c> are</c><00:10:30.160><c> quite</c><00:10:30.399><c> different</c><00:10:30.800><c> to</c><00:10:31.120><c> birds</c>

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
butterflies are quite different to birds
 

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
butterflies are quite different to birds
and<00:10:31.519><c> planes</c><00:10:31.760><c> they're</c><00:10:31.920><c> actually</c><00:10:32.240><c> much</c><00:10:32.399><c> more</c>

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
and planes they're actually much more
 

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.509 align:start position:0%
and planes they're actually much more
like<00:10:32.800><c> swimmers</c>

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
like swimmers
 

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:35.350 align:start position:0%
like swimmers
so<00:10:33.760><c> they</c><00:10:34.079><c> like</c><00:10:34.240><c> push</c><00:10:34.480><c> the</c><00:10:34.640><c> air</c><00:10:34.800><c> around</c><00:10:35.040><c> them</c><00:10:35.200><c> in</c>

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
so they like push the air around them in
 

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.870 align:start position:0%
so they like push the air around them in
order<00:10:35.600><c> to</c><00:10:35.680><c> move</c><00:10:35.920><c> through</c><00:10:36.079><c> it</c><00:10:36.399><c> right</c>

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
order to move through it right
 

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.030 align:start position:0%
order to move through it right
so<00:10:37.120><c> if</c><00:10:37.200><c> you</c><00:10:37.279><c> look</c><00:10:37.440><c> at</c><00:10:37.519><c> this</c><00:10:38.480><c> lacewing</c><00:10:38.959><c> that</c>

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
so if you look at this lacewing that
 

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.150 align:start position:0%
so if you look at this lacewing that
we've<00:10:39.200><c> captured</c><00:10:39.600><c> here</c>

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
we've captured here
 

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.509 align:start position:0%
we've captured here
you<00:10:40.240><c> can</c><00:10:40.399><c> see</c><00:10:40.560><c> as</c><00:10:40.640><c> it's</c><00:10:40.800><c> taken</c><00:10:41.120><c> off</c><00:10:41.360><c> it's</c>

00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
you can see as it's taken off it's
 

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:43.430 align:start position:0%
you can see as it's taken off it's
peeling<00:10:41.920><c> its</c><00:10:42.079><c> wings</c><00:10:42.320><c> apart</c><00:10:42.880><c> and</c><00:10:43.120><c> from</c><00:10:43.279><c> the</c>

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
peeling its wings apart and from the
 

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.069 align:start position:0%
peeling its wings apart and from the

00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
front
 

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:46.150 align:start position:0%

and<00:10:44.240><c> that</c><00:10:44.560><c> causes</c><00:10:44.959><c> the</c><00:10:45.040><c> air</c><00:10:45.279><c> to</c><00:10:45.440><c> rush</c><00:10:45.680><c> down</c><00:10:46.000><c> and</c>

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that causes the air to rush down and
 

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.750 align:start position:0%
and that causes the air to rush down and
it<00:10:46.240><c> increases</c><00:10:46.720><c> the</c><00:10:46.880><c> force</c><00:10:47.120><c> of</c><00:10:47.279><c> the</c><00:10:47.360><c> downward</c>

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
it increases the force of the downward
 

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.470 align:start position:0%
it increases the force of the downward
push

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
push
 

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.310 align:start position:0%

and<00:10:48.560><c> which</c><00:10:48.880><c> which</c><00:10:49.120><c> allows</c><00:10:49.440><c> it</c><00:10:49.519><c> to</c><00:10:49.680><c> lift</c><00:10:50.160><c> so</c><00:10:50.320><c> you</c>

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
and which which allows it to lift so you
 

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.069 align:start position:0%
and which which allows it to lift so you
can<00:10:50.480><c> see</c><00:10:50.560><c> this</c><00:10:50.720><c> guy</c><00:10:50.959><c> is</c><00:10:51.200><c> coming</c><00:10:51.440><c> in</c><00:10:51.680><c> and</c>

00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
can see this guy is coming in and
 

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:53.910 align:start position:0%
can see this guy is coming in and

really throwing on the brakes or trying
 

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.190 align:start position:0%
really throwing on the brakes or trying

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
to maneuver i'm not sure exactly what's
 

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.630 align:start position:0%
to maneuver i'm not sure exactly what's
going<00:10:55.440><c> on</c><00:10:55.519><c> there</c><00:10:55.760><c> you</c><00:10:55.839><c> see</c><00:10:56.079><c> how</c><00:10:56.320><c> it</c><00:10:56.399><c> gets</c><00:10:56.560><c> its</c>

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
going on there you see how it gets its
 

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.389 align:start position:0%
going on there you see how it gets its
wings<00:10:56.959><c> at</c><00:10:57.040><c> quite</c><00:10:57.200><c> a</c><00:10:57.279><c> steep</c><00:10:57.600><c> angle</c><00:10:58.000><c> yep</c>

00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
wings at quite a steep angle yep
 

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.829 align:start position:0%
wings at quite a steep angle yep
one<00:10:58.560><c> of</c><00:10:58.640><c> the</c><00:10:58.720><c> ways</c><00:10:58.959><c> they</c><00:10:59.120><c> do</c><00:10:59.279><c> this</c><00:10:59.519><c> is</c><00:10:59.600><c> they</c>

00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
one of the ways they do this is they
 

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:01.670 align:start position:0%
one of the ways they do this is they
create<00:11:00.160><c> like</c><00:11:00.320><c> these</c><00:11:00.480><c> swirling</c><00:11:00.959><c> vortices</c><00:11:01.600><c> on</c>

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
create like these swirling vortices on
 

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.949 align:start position:0%
create like these swirling vortices on
the<00:11:01.760><c> edges</c><00:11:02.079><c> of</c><00:11:02.160><c> their</c><00:11:02.399><c> wings</c>

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
the edges of their wings
 

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:05.670 align:start position:0%
the edges of their wings
which<00:11:03.279><c> is</c><00:11:03.440><c> kind</c><00:11:03.680><c> of</c><00:11:03.760><c> like</c><00:11:04.079><c> a</c><00:11:04.240><c> mini</c><00:11:04.800><c> whirlwind</c>

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
which is kind of like a mini whirlwind
 

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.350 align:start position:0%
which is kind of like a mini whirlwind
so<00:11:05.920><c> by</c><00:11:06.079><c> doing</c><00:11:06.320><c> that</c><00:11:06.480><c> these</c><00:11:06.720><c> whirlwinds</c><00:11:07.200><c> kind</c>

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
so by doing that these whirlwinds kind
 

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.470 align:start position:0%
so by doing that these whirlwinds kind
of<00:11:07.600><c> create</c><00:11:07.920><c> a</c><00:11:08.000><c> push</c>

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
of create a push

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
so when he takes off kind of
 

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.790 align:start position:0%
so when he takes off kind of
leaves<00:11:16.880><c> his</c><00:11:17.120><c> legs</c><00:11:17.680><c> hanging</c><00:11:18.079><c> for</c><00:11:18.240><c> a</c><00:11:18.240><c> little</c><00:11:18.480><c> bit</c>

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
will raise one leg in the air to kind of
 

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:24.150 align:start position:0%
will raise one leg in the air to kind of
do<00:11:22.240><c> their</c><00:11:22.399><c> pre-flight</c><00:11:22.959><c> checks</c><00:11:23.279><c> as</c><00:11:23.440><c> if</c><00:11:23.600><c> they're</c>

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
do their pre-flight checks as if they're

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
off and then yeah they've got sensors in
 

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:27.990 align:start position:0%
off and then yeah they've got sensors in
their<00:11:27.600><c> feet</c>

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
their feet
 

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.590 align:start position:0%
their feet
and<00:11:28.320><c> once</c><00:11:28.560><c> they</c><00:11:28.720><c> realize</c><00:11:29.040><c> the</c><00:11:29.120><c> conditions</c><00:11:29.519><c> are</c>

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
and once they realize the conditions are
 

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.110 align:start position:0%
and once they realize the conditions are
good<00:11:29.760><c> they</c><00:11:29.920><c> can</c><00:11:30.240><c> take</c><00:11:30.480><c> off</c><00:11:30.720><c> pretty</c>

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
good they can take off pretty
 

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:42.700 align:start position:0%
good they can take off pretty
pretty<00:11:31.360><c> techy</c><00:11:31.680><c> little</c><00:11:31.920><c> animals</c><00:11:32.240><c> then</c><00:11:40.839><c> yeah</c>

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:42.710 align:start position:0%
pretty techy little animals then yeah
 

00:11:42.710 --> 00:12:09.269 align:start position:0%
pretty techy little animals then yeah
[Music]

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:11.350 align:start position:0%
 
whoa<00:12:09.760><c> that's</c><00:12:10.160><c> awesome</c><00:12:10.800><c> they</c><00:12:10.959><c> actually</c><00:12:11.200><c> look</c>

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
whoa that's awesome they actually look
 

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.870 align:start position:0%
whoa that's awesome they actually look
pretty<00:12:11.600><c> clumsy</c><00:12:12.000><c> when</c><00:12:12.160><c> they</c><00:12:12.240><c> take</c><00:12:12.480><c> off</c>

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
pretty clumsy when they take off
 

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.110 align:start position:0%
pretty clumsy when they take off
yeah<00:12:13.279><c> and</c><00:12:13.440><c> that</c><00:12:13.920><c> irregularity</c><00:12:14.639><c> actually</c>

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and that irregularity actually
 

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.389 align:start position:0%
yeah and that irregularity actually
works<00:12:15.360><c> to</c><00:12:15.440><c> their</c><00:12:15.680><c> advantage</c>

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
works to their advantage
 

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:17.829 align:start position:0%
works to their advantage
so<00:12:16.560><c> if</c><00:12:16.639><c> you</c><00:12:16.720><c> think</c><00:12:16.880><c> about</c><00:12:17.120><c> if</c><00:12:17.200><c> you</c><00:12:17.360><c> slam</c><00:12:17.600><c> a</c><00:12:17.680><c> book</c>

00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
so if you think about if you slam a book
 

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
so if you think about if you slam a book
shirt<00:12:18.079><c> like</c><00:12:18.240><c> this</c><00:12:18.720><c> it</c><00:12:18.880><c> kind</c><00:12:19.040><c> of</c><00:12:19.120><c> causes</c><00:12:19.600><c> a</c>

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
shirt like this it kind of causes a
 

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.430 align:start position:0%
shirt like this it kind of causes a

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
push of air to move up and the butterfly
 

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.269 align:start position:0%
push of air to move up and the butterfly
uses<00:12:21.760><c> that</c><00:12:21.920><c> to</c><00:12:22.000><c> move</c><00:12:22.320><c> down</c><00:12:22.800><c> and</c><00:12:22.959><c> kind</c><00:12:23.120><c> of</c>

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
uses that to move down and kind of
 

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:24.870 align:start position:0%
uses that to move down and kind of
combined<00:12:23.680><c> with</c><00:12:23.760><c> the</c><00:12:23.920><c> other</c><00:12:24.240><c> aerodynamic</c>

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
combined with the other aerodynamic
 

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.470 align:start position:0%
combined with the other aerodynamic
maneuvers<00:12:25.360><c> that</c><00:12:25.519><c> it's</c><00:12:25.680><c> capable</c><00:12:26.079><c> of</c>

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
maneuvers that it's capable of
 

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.550 align:start position:0%
maneuvers that it's capable of
that's<00:12:26.720><c> what</c><00:12:26.880><c> we</c><00:12:27.040><c> see</c><00:12:27.200><c> as</c><00:12:27.360><c> a</c><00:12:27.440><c> flutter</c><00:12:28.160><c> and</c><00:12:28.399><c> it</c>

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we see as a flutter and it
 

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.150 align:start position:0%
that's what we see as a flutter and it
actually<00:12:29.120><c> makes</c><00:12:29.360><c> it</c><00:12:29.440><c> much</c><00:12:29.600><c> more</c><00:12:29.760><c> difficult</c>

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
actually makes it much more difficult
 

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.110 align:start position:0%
actually makes it much more difficult
for<00:12:30.320><c> predators</c><00:12:30.800><c> to</c>

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
for predators to
 

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.790 align:start position:0%

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
catch them in the wild so if you think
 

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.150 align:start position:0%
catch them in the wild so if you think
about<00:12:33.040><c> if</c><00:12:33.200><c> you</c><00:12:33.279><c> were</c><00:12:33.360><c> in</c><00:12:33.440><c> the</c><00:12:33.600><c> street</c><00:12:33.839><c> and</c><00:12:34.000><c> you</c>

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
about if you were in the street and you
 

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.990 align:start position:0%
about if you were in the street and you
did<00:12:34.320><c> like</c><00:12:34.560><c> a</c><00:12:34.639><c> combination</c><00:12:35.200><c> of</c><00:12:35.279><c> a</c><00:12:35.360><c> harper</c><00:12:35.760><c> skip</c>

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
did like a combination of a harper skip
 

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.509 align:start position:0%
did like a combination of a harper skip
and<00:12:36.079><c> a</c><00:12:36.160><c> backflip</c><00:12:36.639><c> instead</c><00:12:36.959><c> of</c><00:12:37.040><c> a</c><00:12:37.120><c> walk</c><00:12:37.440><c> it</c>

00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
and a backflip instead of a walk it
 

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:38.870 align:start position:0%
and a backflip instead of a walk it
would<00:12:37.680><c> people</c><00:12:37.920><c> would</c><00:12:38.079><c> think</c><00:12:38.240><c> i</c><00:12:38.399><c> was</c><00:12:38.560><c> mad</c>

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
would people would think i was mad
 

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.150 align:start position:0%
would people would think i was mad
they<00:12:39.040><c> would</c><00:12:39.120><c> think</c><00:12:39.360><c> you</c><00:12:39.440><c> were</c><00:12:39.600><c> mad</c><00:12:39.920><c> but</c><00:12:40.079><c> it</c>

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
they would think you were mad but it
 

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.670 align:start position:0%
they would think you were mad but it
would<00:12:40.320><c> make</c><00:12:40.480><c> you</c><00:12:40.639><c> much</c><00:12:40.880><c> less</c><00:12:41.040><c> predictable</c>

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
would make you much less predictable
 

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.069 align:start position:0%
would make you much less predictable
yeah

00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:43.590 align:start position:0%
yeah
they're<00:12:42.240><c> not</c><00:12:42.399><c> as</c><00:12:42.639><c> clumsy</c><00:12:42.959><c> as</c><00:12:43.120><c> they</c><00:12:43.200><c> might</c><00:12:43.440><c> look</c>

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
they're not as clumsy as they might look
 

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.550 align:start position:0%
they're not as clumsy as they might look
there's<00:12:43.920><c> actually</c><00:12:44.160><c> quite</c><00:12:44.320><c> a</c><00:12:44.399><c> lot</c><00:12:44.480><c> of</c>

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
there's actually quite a lot of
 

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.190 align:start position:0%
there's actually quite a lot of
technique<00:12:44.880><c> too</c>

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
technique too
 

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.710 align:start position:0%
technique too
there's<00:12:45.519><c> a</c><00:12:45.600><c> lot</c><00:12:45.760><c> of</c><00:12:45.920><c> technique</c><00:12:46.320><c> going</c><00:12:46.560><c> on</c>

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of technique going on
 

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.490 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of technique going on
there<00:12:46.880><c> yeah</c><00:12:47.120><c> we</c><00:12:47.279><c> just</c><00:12:47.440><c> don't</c><00:12:47.680><c> see</c><00:12:47.839><c> it</c><00:12:48.000><c> in</c><00:12:48.079><c> real</c>

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:48.500 align:start position:0%
there yeah we just don't see it in real
 

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.829 align:start position:0%
there yeah we just don't see it in real

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:55.350 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:14.069 align:start position:0%

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:13:14.240><c> this</c><00:13:14.480><c> long</c><00:13:14.720><c> appendage</c><00:13:15.200><c> that</c><00:13:15.279><c> we're</c><00:13:15.360><c> seeing</c>

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
so this long appendage that we're seeing
 

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.509 align:start position:0%
so this long appendage that we're seeing
here<00:13:15.839><c> is</c><00:13:16.000><c> called</c><00:13:16.160><c> a</c><00:13:16.240><c> proboscis</c><00:13:16.959><c> and</c><00:13:17.120><c> it's</c><00:13:17.279><c> what</c>

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
here is called a proboscis and it's what
 

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:19.030 align:start position:0%
here is called a proboscis and it's what
butterflies<00:13:18.079><c> use</c><00:13:18.320><c> to</c><00:13:18.480><c> feed</c>

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
butterflies use to feed
 

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.069 align:start position:0%
butterflies use to feed
so<00:13:19.279><c> it's</c><00:13:19.440><c> kind</c><00:13:19.680><c> of</c><00:13:19.839><c> like</c><00:13:20.399><c> a</c><00:13:20.800><c> modified</c><00:13:21.440><c> jaw</c>

00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of like a modified jaw
 

00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of like a modified jaw
so<00:13:22.480><c> two</c><00:13:22.720><c> segments</c><00:13:23.120><c> kind</c><00:13:23.279><c> of</c><00:13:23.360><c> come</c><00:13:23.600><c> together</c><00:13:23.920><c> to</c>

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
so two segments kind of come together to
 

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.190 align:start position:0%
so two segments kind of come together to
form<00:13:24.240><c> a</c><00:13:24.399><c> tube</c><00:13:24.800><c> so</c>

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
form a tube so
 

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.509 align:start position:0%
form a tube so
the<00:13:25.360><c> main</c><00:13:25.600><c> staple</c><00:13:26.000><c> of</c><00:13:26.160><c> a</c><00:13:26.240><c> butterfly's</c><00:13:26.720><c> diet</c><00:13:27.120><c> is</c>

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
the main staple of a butterfly's diet is
 

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:29.190 align:start position:0%
the main staple of a butterfly's diet is
nectar<00:13:27.920><c> but</c><00:13:28.079><c> as</c><00:13:28.160><c> you</c><00:13:28.240><c> can</c><00:13:28.399><c> see</c><00:13:28.560><c> here</c><00:13:28.720><c> they</c><00:13:28.880><c> also</c>

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
nectar but as you can see here they also
 

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.150 align:start position:0%
nectar but as you can see here they also
eat<00:13:29.360><c> fruit</c>

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
eat fruit
 

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.509 align:start position:0%
eat fruit
and<00:13:30.320><c> what's</c><00:13:30.639><c> really</c><00:13:30.880><c> interesting</c><00:13:31.360><c> about</c>

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
and what's really interesting about
 

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.350 align:start position:0%
and what's really interesting about
these<00:13:31.760><c> guys</c><00:13:32.000><c> is</c><00:13:32.160><c> that</c><00:13:32.399><c> they</c><00:13:32.639><c> taste</c><00:13:32.959><c> with</c><00:13:33.120><c> their</c>

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
these guys is that they taste with their
 

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.030 align:start position:0%
these guys is that they taste with their
feet

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
feet
 

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.629 align:start position:0%
feet
so<00:13:35.200><c> that</c><00:13:35.360><c> would</c><00:13:35.440><c> mean</c><00:13:35.600><c> i'd</c><00:13:35.760><c> be</c><00:13:36.079><c> tasting</c><00:13:36.480><c> my</c>

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
so that would mean i'd be tasting my
 

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:38.790 align:start position:0%
so that would mean i'd be tasting my
socks<00:13:37.040><c> or</c><00:13:37.200><c> something</c><00:13:37.600><c> yeah</c><00:13:37.920><c> pretty</c><00:13:38.240><c> much</c>

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
socks or something yeah pretty much
 

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.470 align:start position:0%
socks or something yeah pretty much
so<00:13:38.959><c> they've</c><00:13:39.120><c> got</c><00:13:39.279><c> these</c><00:13:39.519><c> uh</c><00:13:39.920><c> these</c><00:13:40.160><c> things</c><00:13:40.399><c> in</c>

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
so they've got these uh these things in
 

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.150 align:start position:0%
so they've got these uh these things in
their<00:13:40.720><c> feet</c><00:13:40.880><c> called</c><00:13:41.120><c> chemoreceptors</c>

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
their feet called chemoreceptors
 

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.990 align:start position:0%
their feet called chemoreceptors
and<00:13:42.480><c> when</c><00:13:42.639><c> they</c><00:13:42.800><c> land</c><00:13:43.040><c> on</c><00:13:43.120><c> something</c><00:13:43.440><c> sweet</c><00:13:43.760><c> it</c>

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
and when they land on something sweet it
 

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.910 align:start position:0%
and when they land on something sweet it
tells<00:13:44.320><c> their</c><00:13:44.480><c> proboscis</c><00:13:45.040><c> to</c><00:13:45.199><c> unroll</c><00:13:45.600><c> and</c><00:13:45.760><c> to</c>

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
tells their proboscis to unroll and to
 

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.310 align:start position:0%
tells their proboscis to unroll and to
drink

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
drink
 

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.570 align:start position:0%
drink
wow<00:13:46.560><c> that's</c><00:13:46.720><c> incredible</c><00:13:47.519><c> really</c><00:13:47.680><c> cool</c>

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:48.580 align:start position:0%

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
so you can see with this species at the
 

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.550 align:start position:0%
so you can see with this species at the
wings<00:14:07.199><c> of</c><00:14:07.279><c> this</c><00:14:07.440><c> brilliant</c><00:14:07.760><c> blue</c><00:14:08.000><c> color</c>

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
wings of this brilliant blue color
 

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.550 align:start position:0%
wings of this brilliant blue color
but<00:14:08.800><c> actually</c><00:14:09.199><c> they're</c><00:14:09.519><c> brown</c><00:14:10.000><c> there's</c><00:14:10.240><c> tiny</c>

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
but actually they're brown there's tiny
 

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.310 align:start position:0%
but actually they're brown there's tiny
structures<00:14:11.120><c> on</c><00:14:11.279><c> the</c><00:14:11.519><c> surface</c><00:14:11.920><c> of</c><00:14:12.000><c> the</c><00:14:12.079><c> wing</c>

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
structures on the surface of the wing
 

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.350 align:start position:0%
structures on the surface of the wing
and<00:14:12.399><c> they're</c><00:14:12.560><c> disrupting</c><00:14:13.040><c> the</c><00:14:13.120><c> light</c>

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
and they're disrupting the light
 

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.189 align:start position:0%
and they're disrupting the light
frequencies<00:14:13.920><c> so</c><00:14:14.079><c> that</c><00:14:14.240><c> it's</c><00:14:14.480><c> only</c><00:14:14.720><c> reflecting</c>

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
frequencies so that it's only reflecting
blue<00:14:15.519><c> light</c><00:14:15.839><c> oh</c><00:14:16.079><c> wow</c>

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
