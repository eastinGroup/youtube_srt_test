00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 align:start position:0%
it much more comfortable for the need to
 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.990 align:start position:0%
it much more comfortable for the need to
move<00:00:31.170><c> but</c><00:00:31.770><c> it</c><00:00:31.920><c> also</c><00:00:32.099><c> means</c><00:00:32.460><c> that</c><00:00:32.640><c> they</c><00:00:32.760><c> have</c><00:00:32.879><c> to</c>

what<00:00:40.920><c> we</c><00:00:41.040><c> got</c><00:00:41.160><c> going</c><00:00:41.610><c> on</c><00:00:41.670><c> behind</c><00:00:41.820><c> us</c><00:00:42.000><c> here</c><00:00:42.210><c> and</c>

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 align:start position:0%
what we got going on behind us here and
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.569 align:start position:0%
what we got going on behind us here and
we've<00:00:42.870><c> got</c><00:00:42.899><c> a</c><00:00:43.050><c> large</c><00:00:43.350><c> heated</c><00:00:43.920><c> swimming</c><00:00:44.309><c> pool</c>

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
we've got a large heated swimming pool
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.910 align:start position:0%
we've got a large heated swimming pool
because<00:00:45.360><c> it's</c><00:00:45.510><c> heated</c><00:00:45.930><c> it</c><00:00:46.140><c> has</c><00:00:46.320><c> to</c><00:00:46.500><c> make</c><00:00:46.649><c> Delta</c>

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
because it's heated it has to make Delta
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.709 align:start position:0%
because it's heated it has to make Delta
move<00:00:47.309><c> more</c><00:00:47.579><c> comfortably</c><00:00:48.059><c> increases</c><00:00:48.630><c> the</c>

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
move more comfortably increases the
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.869 align:start position:0%
move more comfortably increases the
blood<00:00:48.899><c> supply</c><00:00:49.020><c> to</c><00:00:49.260><c> their</c><00:00:49.739><c> peripheral</c><00:00:50.489><c> areas</c>

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 align:start position:0%
blood supply to their peripheral areas
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
blood supply to their peripheral areas
their<00:00:51.120><c> limbs</c><00:00:51.390><c> which</c><00:00:51.899><c> aids</c><00:00:52.230><c> with</c><00:00:52.559><c> reducing</c>

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 align:start position:0%
their limbs which aids with reducing
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.889 align:start position:0%
their limbs which aids with reducing
pain<00:00:53.280><c> and</c><00:00:53.520><c> also</c><00:00:53.790><c> that</c><00:00:53.969><c> helps</c><00:00:54.059><c> them</c><00:00:54.329><c> move</c><00:00:54.510><c> more</c>

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
pain and also that helps them move more
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.290 align:start position:0%
pain and also that helps them move more
easily<00:00:55.050><c> so</c><00:00:56.040><c> we</c><00:00:56.160><c> think</c><00:00:56.370><c> of</c><00:00:56.550><c> doggy</c><00:00:56.820><c> paddle</c><00:00:57.180><c> that</c>

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
easily so we think of doggy paddle that
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.270 align:start position:0%
easily so we think of doggy paddle that
we<00:00:57.660><c> passed</c><00:00:57.899><c> and</c><00:00:57.989><c> dual</c><00:00:58.289><c> wheel</c><00:00:58.440><c> ends</c><00:00:58.649><c> yeah</c><00:00:59.010><c> I</c>

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
we passed and dual wheel ends yeah I
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.860 align:start position:0%
we passed and dual wheel ends yeah I
mean<00:00:59.700><c> are</c><00:00:59.910><c> there</c><00:00:59.969><c> any</c><00:01:00.030><c> different</c><00:01:00.570><c> kinds</c><00:01:00.809><c> of</c>

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 align:start position:0%
mean are there any different kinds of
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 align:start position:0%
mean are there any different kinds of
puddle<00:01:01.289><c> of</c><00:01:01.379><c> you</c><00:01:01.500><c> sort</c><00:01:01.649><c> of</c><00:01:01.710><c> turn</c><00:01:02.010><c> they</c><00:01:02.340><c> all</c><00:01:02.520><c> have</c>

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
puddle of you sort of turn they all have
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.249 align:start position:0%
puddle of you sort of turn they all have
their<00:01:03.030><c> own</c><00:01:03.059><c> particular</c><00:01:03.329><c> style</c><00:01:03.840><c> and</c><00:01:04.080><c> you'll</c>

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 align:start position:0%
their own particular style and you'll
 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
their own particular style and you'll
see<00:01:04.500><c> if</c><00:01:04.800><c> the</c><00:01:04.920><c> thoughts</c><00:01:05.190><c> moving</c><00:01:05.610><c> quite</c>

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 align:start position:0%
see if the thoughts moving quite
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.910 align:start position:0%
see if the thoughts moving quite
differently<00:01:06.300><c> and</c><00:01:06.780><c> the</c><00:01:07.259><c> difference</c><00:01:07.619><c> between</c>

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
