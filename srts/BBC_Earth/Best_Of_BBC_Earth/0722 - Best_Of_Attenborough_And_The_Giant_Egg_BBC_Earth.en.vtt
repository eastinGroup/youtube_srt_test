00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.510 align:start position:0%

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:05:13.280><c> there</c><00:05:13.440><c> we</c><00:05:13.600><c> have</c><00:05:13.840><c> it</c><00:05:14.560><c> my</c><00:05:14.800><c> egg</c><00:05:15.280><c> is</c><00:05:15.520><c> 1300</c><00:05:16.240><c> years</c>
