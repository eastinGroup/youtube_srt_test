00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.729 align:start position:0%
the driving force of the flight through

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 align:start position:0%
and then these tail feathers they're the
 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
and then these tail feathers they're the
wreck<00:03:18.130><c> tri-c's</c><00:03:18.580><c> is</c><00:03:18.730><c> that</c><00:03:18.820><c> right</c><00:03:18.970><c> yeah</c><00:03:19.330><c> and</c>

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 align:start position:0%
wreck tri-c's is that right yeah and
 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
wreck tri-c's is that right yeah and
that<00:03:19.930><c> translates</c><00:03:20.380><c> as</c><00:03:20.530><c> helmsman</c><00:03:21.130><c> so</c><00:03:21.489><c> that's</c>

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 align:start position:0%
that translates as helmsman so that's
 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
that translates as helmsman so that's
