00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:55.209 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not so straightforward it's
 

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:56.519 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not so straightforward it's
just<00:07:55.360><c> being</c><00:07:55.509><c> consistent</c><00:07:56.139><c> I</c><00:07:56.289><c> would</c><00:07:56.409><c> say</c>

00:07:56.529 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
just being consistent I would say
consistency<00:07:57.249><c> in</c><00:07:57.369><c> one</c><00:07:57.729><c> but</c><00:07:58.119><c> then</c><00:07:58.300><c> also</c><00:07:58.569><c> there's</c>

00:07:58.919 --> 00:07:58.929 align:start position:0%
consistency in one but then also there's
 

00:07:58.929 --> 00:08:00.749 align:start position:0%
consistency in one but then also there's
a<00:07:58.989><c> lot</c><00:07:59.019><c> else</c><00:07:59.439><c> that</c><00:07:59.739><c> goes</c><00:07:59.860><c> into</c><00:08:00.129><c> it</c><00:08:00.399><c> I</c><00:08:00.429><c> think</c><00:08:00.699><c> a</c>

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:00.759 align:start position:0%
a lot else that goes into it I think a
 

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:02.159 align:start position:0%

00:16:45.569 --> 00:16:45.579 align:start position:0%

unfortunately okay so next question is
how<00:20:50.809><c> to</c><00:20:50.870><c> do</c><00:20:51.080><c> that</c><00:20:51.200><c> a</c><00:20:51.260><c> break</c><00:20:51.500><c> it</c><00:20:51.710><c> was</c><00:20:51.830><c> the</c><00:20:51.919><c> right</c>

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:52.070 align:start position:0%
how to do that a break it was the right
 

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.129 align:start position:0%
how to do that a break it was the right
thing<00:20:52.100><c> to</c><00:20:52.399><c> do</c><00:20:52.549><c> I</c><00:20:52.850><c> think</c><00:20:53.240><c> that</c><00:20:53.450><c> this</c><00:20:53.690><c> is</c><00:20:53.840><c> really</c>

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:54.139 align:start position:0%
thing to do I think that this is really
 

00:20:54.139 --> 00:20:55.659 align:start position:0%
thing to do I think that this is really
hard<00:20:54.470><c> because</c><00:20:54.710><c> it</c><00:20:54.919><c> just</c><00:20:55.070><c> depends</c><00:20:55.460><c> why</c><00:20:55.610><c> you</c>

00:20:55.659 --> 00:20:55.669 align:start position:0%
hard because it just depends why you
 

00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:58.090 align:start position:0%
hard because it just depends why you
broke<00:20:55.970><c> up</c><00:20:56.240><c> but</c><00:20:56.659><c> I</c><00:20:56.809><c> always</c><00:20:57.139><c> say</c><00:20:57.529><c> when</c><00:20:57.769><c> you</c><00:20:57.889><c> break</c>

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:58.100 align:start position:0%
broke up but I always say when you break
 

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.220 align:start position:0%
broke up but I always say when you break
up<00:20:58.340><c> with</c><00:20:58.460><c> someone</c><00:20:58.700><c> you</c><00:20:59.450><c> need</c><00:20:59.570><c> to</c><00:20:59.690><c> write</c><00:20:59.840><c> a</c><00:20:59.870><c> list</c>

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:00.230 align:start position:0%

a massive recession after all of this so
 

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
a massive recession after all of this so
personally<00:22:27.190><c> my</c><00:22:28.190><c> advice</c><00:22:28.580><c> would</c><00:22:28.820><c> be</c><00:22:28.880><c> not</c><00:22:29.420><c> to</c><00:22:29.990><c> buy</c>

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:30.170 align:start position:0%
personally my advice would be not to buy
 

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:31.870 align:start position:0%
personally my advice would be not to buy
a<00:22:30.200><c> house</c><00:22:30.440><c> now</c><00:22:30.470><c> because</c><00:22:31.220><c> I</c><00:22:31.280><c> think</c><00:22:31.340><c> what</c><00:22:31.730><c> you're</c>

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
a house now because I think what you're
 

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.940 align:start position:0%
a house now because I think what you're
gonna<00:22:32.000><c> find</c><00:22:32.270><c> is</c><00:22:32.780><c> you're</c><00:22:33.290><c> gonna</c><00:22:33.380><c> buy</c><00:22:33.680><c> a</c><00:22:33.710><c> house</c>

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:33.950 align:start position:0%
gonna find is you're gonna buy a house
 

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
gonna find is you're gonna buy a house
and<00:22:34.850><c> then</c><00:22:34.910><c> it's</c><00:22:35.210><c> just</c><00:22:35.300><c> gonna</c><00:22:35.510><c> go</c><00:22:35.750><c> down</c><00:22:36.020><c> in</c>

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:36.290 align:start position:0%
and then it's just gonna go down in
 

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.410 align:start position:0%
and then it's just gonna go down in
value<00:22:36.440><c> like</c><00:22:36.920><c> obviously</c><00:22:37.820><c> it'll</c><00:22:37.940><c> go</c><00:22:38.060><c> back</c><00:22:38.270><c> up</c>

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:38.420 align:start position:0%
value like obviously it'll go back up
 

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.860 align:start position:0%
value like obviously it'll go back up
eventually<00:22:38.780><c> but</c><00:22:39.760><c> it</c><00:22:40.760><c> would</c><00:22:40.940><c> be</c><00:22:41.090><c> better</c><00:22:41.390><c> to</c><00:22:41.600><c> buy</c>

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:41.870 align:start position:0%
eventually but it would be better to buy
 

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.950 align:start position:0%
eventually but it would be better to buy
a<00:22:41.900><c> house</c><00:22:42.230><c> if</c><00:22:42.920><c> you</c><00:22:43.340><c> can</c><00:22:43.490><c> just</c><00:22:43.640><c> afford</c><00:22:43.820><c> to</c><00:22:44.210><c> when</c>

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
a house if you can just afford to when
 

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.390 align:start position:0%
a house if you can just afford to when
the<00:22:45.110><c> recession</c><00:22:45.410><c> hit</c><00:22:45.560><c> because</c><00:22:45.980><c> the</c><00:22:46.130><c> house</c>

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
the recession hit because the house
 

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.670 align:start position:0%
the recession hit because the house
prices<00:22:46.700><c> are</c><00:22:46.850><c> going</c><00:22:46.970><c> to</c><00:22:47.030><c> drop</c><00:22:47.240><c> so</c><00:22:47.840><c> yeah</c><00:22:48.320><c> it</c>

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
prices are going to drop so yeah it
 

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.310 align:start position:0%
prices are going to drop so yeah it
would<00:22:49.040><c> make</c><00:22:49.190><c> sense</c><00:22:49.400><c> because</c><00:22:49.850><c> otherwise</c><00:22:50.450><c> let's</c>

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
would make sense because otherwise let's
 

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.970 align:start position:0%
would make sense because otherwise let's
say<00:22:51.470><c> you</c><00:22:51.620><c> buy</c><00:22:51.860><c> house</c><00:22:52.130><c> the</c><00:22:52.960><c> 300</c><00:22:53.960><c> grand</c><00:22:53.990><c> and</c><00:22:54.680><c> then</c>

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:54.980 align:start position:0%
say you buy house the 300 grand and then
 

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.830 align:start position:0%
say you buy house the 300 grand and then
we're<00:22:55.430><c> going</c><00:22:55.550><c> to</c><00:22:55.640><c> massive</c><00:22:56.060><c> recession</c><00:22:56.330><c> and</c>

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to massive recession and
 

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.290 align:start position:0%
we're going to massive recession and
house<00:22:56.990><c> prices</c><00:22:57.320><c> drop</c><00:22:57.740><c> drop</c><00:22:58.070><c> to</c><00:22:58.220><c> like</c><00:22:58.370><c> 260</c><00:22:59.120><c> let's</c>

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:24.350 align:start position:0%
in the economy but like I said as well
 

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.310 align:start position:0%
in the economy but like I said as well
I'm<00:23:24.620><c> also</c><00:23:24.860><c> waiting</c><00:23:25.330><c> until</c><00:23:26.330><c> the</c><00:23:26.810><c> recession</c>

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
