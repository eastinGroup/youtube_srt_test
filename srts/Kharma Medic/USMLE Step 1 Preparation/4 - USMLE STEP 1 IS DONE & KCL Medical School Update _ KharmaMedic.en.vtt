there's only one placement where it
 

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.829 align:start position:0%
there's only one placement where it
might<00:10:08.640><c> make</c><00:10:08.880><c> more</c><00:10:09.040><c> sense</c><00:10:09.279><c> to</c><00:10:09.360><c> do</c><00:10:09.519><c> that</c><00:10:09.680><c> because</c>

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
might make more sense to do that because
 

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
might make more sense to do that because
it's<00:10:10.000><c> a</c><00:10:10.000><c> little</c><00:10:10.160><c> bit</c><00:10:10.320><c> further</c><00:10:10.640><c> away</c><00:10:10.800><c> but</c><00:10:10.959><c> i</c>

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit further away but i
 

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.310 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit further away but i
think<00:10:11.200><c> i'll</c><00:10:11.279><c> see</c><00:10:11.440><c> how</c><00:10:11.600><c> it</c><00:10:11.680><c> goes</c><00:10:11.920><c> when</c><00:10:12.079><c> we</c><00:10:12.160><c> get</c>

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
think i'll see how it goes when we get
 

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.509 align:start position:0%
think i'll see how it goes when we get
there<00:10:12.480><c> so</c><00:10:12.640><c> yeah</c><00:10:12.800><c> i'll</c><00:10:12.880><c> be</c><00:10:13.040><c> able</c><00:10:13.120><c> to</c><00:10:13.200><c> stay</c><00:10:13.440><c> in</c>
