00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:21.970 align:start position:0%
guess you should have known but he's not
 

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
guess you should have known but he's not

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:23.470 align:start position:0%
saying it in that way he's saying I
 

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
saying it in that way he's saying I
thought<00:17:23.740><c> you</c><00:17:23.920><c> knew</c><00:17:24.160><c> when</c><00:17:24.340><c> I</c><00:17:24.430><c> thought</c><00:17:24.610><c> you</c>

thought you knew when I thought you
 

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.130 align:start position:0%
thought you knew when I thought you
should<00:17:25.000><c> I</c><00:17:25.210><c> thought</c><00:17:25.480><c> you</c><00:17:25.600><c> would</c><00:17:25.750><c> have</c><00:17:25.870><c> known</c>

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:26.140 align:start position:0%
should I thought you would have known
 

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
should I thought you would have known
that<00:17:26.980><c> the</c><00:17:27.340><c> doors</c><00:17:27.490><c> are</c><00:17:27.610><c> locked</c><00:17:27.670><c> at</c><00:17:27.940><c> this</c><00:17:28.060><c> time</c>

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:28.270 align:start position:0%
that the doors are locked at this time
 

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.810 align:start position:0%
that the doors are locked at this time
so<00:17:28.600><c> I</c><00:17:29.040><c> think</c><00:17:30.040><c> that's</c><00:17:30.310><c> totally</c><00:17:30.520><c> appropriate</c>

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:30.820 align:start position:0%
so I think that's totally appropriate
 

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.330 align:start position:0%
so I think that's totally appropriate
and<00:17:31.270><c> yeah</c><00:17:32.170><c> it's</c><00:17:32.710><c> a</c><00:17:32.770><c> good</c><00:17:33.070><c> piece</c><00:17:33.310><c> of</c>

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:33.340 align:start position:0%
and yeah it's a good piece of
 

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.190 align:start position:0%
and yeah it's a good piece of
information<00:17:33.490><c> to</c><00:17:34.000><c> say</c><00:17:34.150><c> because</c><00:17:34.390><c> if</c><00:17:34.660><c> she</c><00:17:34.930><c> didn't</c>

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
think this is a pretty similar analogy
 

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.340 align:start position:0%
think this is a pretty similar analogy
so<00:23:26.030><c> yeah</c><00:23:26.120><c> I'd</c><00:23:26.240><c> say</c><00:23:26.300><c> this</c><00:23:26.540><c> is</c><00:23:26.660><c> appropriate</c><00:23:27.170><c> like</c>
