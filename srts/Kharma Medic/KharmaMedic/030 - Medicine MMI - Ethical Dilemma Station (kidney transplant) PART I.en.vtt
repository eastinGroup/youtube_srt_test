00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:37.219 align:start position:0%
to help her kidneys on top of that women
 

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:38.589 align:start position:0%
to help her kidneys on top of that women
when<00:08:37.370><c> they</c><00:08:37.490><c> get</c><00:08:37.639><c> pregnant</c><00:08:37.849><c> can</c><00:08:38.180><c> also</c><00:08:38.300><c> get</c>

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
when they get pregnant can also get
 

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:40.509 align:start position:0%
when they get pregnant can also get
gestational<00:08:39.289><c> diabetes</c><00:08:39.680><c> which</c><00:08:39.919><c> could</c><00:08:40.310><c> also</c>

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
gestational diabetes which could also
 

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:41.709 align:start position:0%
gestational diabetes which could also
lead<00:08:40.819><c> to</c><00:08:40.939><c> higher</c><00:08:41.089><c> blood</c><00:08:41.240><c> pressure</c>

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
lead to higher blood pressure
 

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:44.170 align:start position:0%
lead to higher blood pressure
so<00:08:42.110><c> generally</c><00:08:42.589><c> pregnancy</c><00:08:43.099><c> is</c><00:08:43.219><c> a</c><00:08:43.250><c> big</c><00:08:43.639><c> risk</c><00:08:43.939><c> for</c>
