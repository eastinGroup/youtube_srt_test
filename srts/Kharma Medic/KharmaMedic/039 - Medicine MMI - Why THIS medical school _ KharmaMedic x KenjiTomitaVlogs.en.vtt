like one or two things I mean university
 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.210 align:start position:0%
like one or two things I mean university
is<00:02:20.689><c> really</c><00:02:20.780><c> done</c><00:02:20.989><c> except</c><00:02:21.650><c> the</c><00:02:21.739><c> Kings</c><00:02:21.920><c> I</c><00:02:22.040><c> think</c>

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 align:start position:0%
is really done except the Kings I think
