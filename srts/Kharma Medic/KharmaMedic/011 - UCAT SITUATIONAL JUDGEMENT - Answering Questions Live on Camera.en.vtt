00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 align:start position:0%
problem in the elderly it's something
 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.310 align:start position:0%
problem in the elderly it's something

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
that we call polypharmacy which means
 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
that we call polypharmacy which means
that<00:03:51.440><c> you're</c><00:03:51.530><c> taking</c><00:03:51.920><c> a</c><00:03:52.010><c> lots</c><00:03:52.280><c> of</c><00:03:52.400><c> medications</c>

that you're taking a lots of medications
 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.060 align:start position:0%

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 align:start position:0%
so this is something very important to
 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
so this is something very important to

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 align:start position:0%
address right and the reason for this is
 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.650 align:start position:0%
address right and the reason for this is
that<00:03:57.320><c> if</c><00:03:57.770><c> we</c><00:03:58.220><c> don't</c><00:03:58.459><c> address</c><00:03:58.790><c> this</c><00:03:59.090><c> then</c><00:03:59.420><c> John</c>

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 align:start position:0%
that if we don't address this then John
 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.180 align:start position:0%
that if we don't address this then John
is<00:03:59.810><c> probably</c><00:04:00.110><c> going</c><00:04:00.260><c> to</c><00:04:00.320><c> continue</c><00:04:00.410><c> as</c><00:04:00.950><c> he</c>

saw in the blurb he's had a heart attack
 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
saw in the blurb he's had a heart attack
he's<00:04:15.230><c> had</c><00:04:15.380><c> a</c><00:04:15.410><c> stroke</c><00:04:15.740><c> so</c><00:04:15.980><c> these</c><00:04:16.430><c> medications</c>

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 align:start position:0%
he's had a stroke so these medications
 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
he's had a stroke so these medications
are<00:04:17.150><c> going</c><00:04:17.390><c> to</c><00:04:17.510><c> be</c><00:04:17.600><c> very</c><00:04:17.870><c> important</c><00:04:18.440><c> in</c>

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 align:start position:0%
are going to be very important in
 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.930 align:start position:0%
are going to be very important in

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:34.430 align:start position:0%
five were so I was on the wrong half so
 

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.100 align:start position:0%
five were so I was on the wrong half so
being<00:11:34.700><c> on</c><00:11:34.850><c> the</c><00:11:35.030><c> wrong</c><00:11:35.180><c> half</c><00:11:35.630><c> of</c><00:11:35.960><c> these</c>

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.510 align:start position:0%
being on the wrong half of these
questions<00:11:36.530><c> is</c><00:11:36.710><c> not</c><00:11:37.010><c> good</c>

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:37.520 align:start position:0%

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:41.570 align:start position:0%
the answer is actually appropriate that
 

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
the answer is actually appropriate that

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:49.820 align:start position:0%
but the answer was appropriate since
 

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.490 align:start position:0%
but the answer was appropriate since
both<00:11:50.030><c> of</c><00:11:50.060><c> those</c><00:11:50.300><c> are</c><00:11:50.450><c> in</c><00:11:50.540><c> the</c><00:11:50.570><c> same</c><00:11:50.810><c> half</c><00:11:51.140><c> let's</c>

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:51.500 align:start position:0%
both of those are in the same half let's
 

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.020 align:start position:0%
both of those are in the same half let's
say<00:11:51.680><c> the</c><00:11:51.860><c> top</c><00:11:52.070><c> half</c><00:11:52.280><c> is</c><00:11:52.430><c> appropriate</c><00:11:52.940><c> the</c>

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
say the top half is appropriate the
 

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
say the top half is appropriate the

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:54.770 align:start position:0%
bottom half is inappropriate you would
 

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.710 align:start position:0%
bottom half is inappropriate you would

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
still get partial marks so deciding
 

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.270 align:start position:0%
still get partial marks so deciding

but<00:12:54.680><c> since</c><00:12:54.890><c> I'm</c><00:12:55.010><c> in</c><00:12:55.130><c> the</c><00:12:55.190><c> right</c><00:12:55.310><c> half</c><00:12:55.640><c> I</c><00:12:55.940><c> would</c>

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:56.300 align:start position:0%
but since I'm in the right half I would
 

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.650 align:start position:0%

get<00:12:56.450><c> partial</c><00:12:56.870><c> marks</c><00:12:57.110><c> so</c><00:12:57.470><c> this</c><00:12:57.590><c> is</c><00:12:57.710><c> better</c><00:12:58.010><c> of</c><00:12:58.370><c> a</c>
