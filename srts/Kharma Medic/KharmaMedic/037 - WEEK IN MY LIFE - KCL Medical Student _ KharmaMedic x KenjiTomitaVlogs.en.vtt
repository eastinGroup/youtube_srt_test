00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
started on limbs this year but it's been
 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.730 align:start position:0%
started on limbs this year but it's been
very<00:02:30.040><c> slow</c><00:02:30.550><c> we've</c><00:02:31.300><c> had</c><00:02:31.540><c> um</c><00:02:31.780><c> what's</c><00:02:32.530><c> called</c>

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 align:start position:0%
very slow we've had um what's called
 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
very slow we've had um what's called
surface<00:02:33.070><c> and</c><00:02:33.400><c> not</c><00:02:33.490><c> to</c><00:02:33.610><c> me</c>

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 align:start position:0%
surface and not to me
 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.130 align:start position:0%
surface and not to me
so<00:02:33.970><c> we'll</c><00:02:34.180><c> delve</c><00:02:34.390><c> deeper</c><00:02:34.690><c> into</c><00:02:34.840><c> that</c><00:02:34.930><c> later</c>

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 align:start position:0%
so we'll delve deeper into that later
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.270 align:start position:0%

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
introduction of progress tests so
 

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.569 align:start position:0%
introduction of progress tests so
progress<00:09:22.870><c> has</c><00:09:23.050><c> two</c><00:09:23.199><c> basically</c><00:09:23.620><c> tests</c><00:09:24.310><c> that</c>

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:24.579 align:start position:0%
progress has two basically tests that
 

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:26.490 align:start position:0%
progress has two basically tests that
test<00:09:24.910><c> your</c><00:09:25.480><c> progress</c><00:09:25.660><c> really</c><00:09:25.959><c> nice</c><00:09:26.319><c> your</c>
