00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
glottal t
 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.350 align:start position:0%

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
is when you don't hear the t in words
 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.830 align:start position:0%
is when you don't hear the t in words
but<00:03:47.760><c> instead</c><00:03:48.319><c> the</c><00:03:48.480><c> flow</c><00:03:48.720><c> of</c><00:03:48.879><c> air</c><00:03:49.200><c> is</c><00:03:49.360><c> stopped</c>

but instead the flow of air is stopped
 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.030 align:start position:0%
but instead the flow of air is stopped
and<00:03:50.000><c> then</c><00:03:50.239><c> released</c>

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
and then released
 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.589 align:start position:0%

so<00:03:51.200><c> for</c><00:03:51.440><c> example</c><00:03:51.920><c> instead</c><00:03:52.159><c> of</c><00:03:52.319><c> saying</c><00:03:52.799><c> butter</c>

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
so for example instead of saying butter
 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.030 align:start position:0%
so for example instead of saying butter
some<00:03:53.840><c> people</c><00:03:54.239><c> might</c><00:03:54.480><c> say</c>

some people might say
 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.190 align:start position:0%
some people might say

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
so he doesn't say have got them so we
 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.950 align:start position:0%
so he doesn't say have got them so we

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
the t's are quite distinctive especially
 

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.230 align:start position:0%
the t's are quite distinctive especially
at<00:18:34.320><c> the</c><00:18:34.400><c> end</c><00:18:34.559><c> of</c><00:18:34.720><c> words</c><00:18:35.200><c> and</c><00:18:35.360><c> they</c><00:18:35.520><c> just</c><00:18:35.840><c> link</c>

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of words and they just link
 

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.590 align:start position:0%
at the end of words and they just link

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
to the next words
 

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.830 align:start position:0%
to the next words
so<00:18:37.840><c> they</c><00:18:38.000><c> do</c><00:18:38.240><c> speak</c><00:18:38.640><c> quite</c><00:18:39.039><c> fast</c><00:18:39.440><c> and</c><00:18:39.600><c> it</c><00:18:39.679><c> can</c>

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
so they do speak quite fast and it can
 

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.909 align:start position:0%
so they do speak quite fast and it can
be<00:18:40.080><c> quite</c><00:18:40.480><c> difficult</c><00:18:40.960><c> to</c><00:18:41.120><c> decipher</c><00:18:41.760><c> what</c>

00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
be quite difficult to decipher what
 

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:43.190 align:start position:0%
be quite difficult to decipher what
someone<00:18:42.240><c> is</c><00:18:42.400><c> saying</c>

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
someone is saying
 

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.669 align:start position:0%

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
you'll also hear the rolling of the r
 

00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:47.909 align:start position:0%
you'll also hear the rolling of the r
especially<00:18:46.240><c> at</c><00:18:46.400><c> the</c><00:18:46.640><c> end</c><00:18:46.960><c> of</c><00:18:47.200><c> words</c><00:18:47.679><c> and</c><00:18:47.760><c> then</c>

00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
especially at the end of words and then
 

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.909 align:start position:0%
especially at the end of words and then
again<00:18:48.240><c> that</c><00:18:48.480><c> links</c><00:18:48.720><c> to</c><00:18:48.880><c> the</c><00:18:49.039><c> next</c><00:18:49.440><c> one</c>

00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
again that links to the next one
 

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:52.710 align:start position:0%

so instead of saying our house here he
 

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.710 align:start position:0%
so instead of saying our house here he
says

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
says
 

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.029 align:start position:0%
says

i'd kind of had an idea in our house
 

00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:58.470 align:start position:0%
i'd kind of had an idea in our house

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
when i was reading through so if you've
 

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.150 align:start position:0%
when i was reading through so if you've

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.549 align:start position:0%
never heard this before
you<00:19:00.320><c> might</c><00:19:00.799><c> actually</c><00:19:01.200><c> not</c><00:19:01.440><c> even</c><00:19:01.760><c> understand</c>

00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
you might actually not even understand
 

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.310 align:start position:0%
you might actually not even understand
what<00:19:02.799><c> words</c><00:19:03.120><c> he</c><00:19:03.280><c> is</c><00:19:03.360><c> saying</c><00:19:03.679><c> at</c><00:19:03.840><c> all</c>

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
what words he is saying at all
 

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.710 align:start position:0%
what words he is saying at all
we<00:19:04.559><c> also</c><00:19:04.960><c> have</c><00:19:05.200><c> the</c><00:19:05.360><c> reduction</c><00:19:05.919><c> of</c><00:19:06.080><c> the</c><00:19:06.320><c> h</c>

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
we also have the reduction of the h
 

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.510 align:start position:0%
we also have the reduction of the h
again<00:19:07.120><c> so</c>

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
again so
 

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.150 align:start position:0%
again so
as<00:19:07.679><c> you</c><00:19:07.840><c> can</c><00:19:08.080><c> tell</c><00:19:08.480><c> this</c><00:19:08.799><c> is</c><00:19:09.039><c> typical</c><00:19:09.520><c> of</c><00:19:09.760><c> many</c>

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
as you can tell this is typical of many
 

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.310 align:start position:0%
as you can tell this is typical of many

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:15.669 align:start position:0%
and when he says right across here that
t
