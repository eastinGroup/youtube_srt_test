00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
a general term for all of them but i
 

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.150 align:start position:0%
a general term for all of them but i

i<00:14:58.240><c> don't</c><00:14:58.480><c> know</c><00:14:58.720><c> why</c><00:14:58.880><c> they're</c><00:14:59.120><c> called</c><00:14:59.600><c> tights</c><00:15:00.240><c> i</c>

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.350 align:start position:0%
i don't know why they're called tights i
guess<00:15:00.639><c> because</c><00:15:00.800><c> they</c><00:15:01.040><c> are</c><00:15:01.199><c> quite</c>

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
guess because they are quite
 

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.470 align:start position:0%
guess because they are quite
tight-fitting

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
tight-fitting
 

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.230 align:start position:0%
