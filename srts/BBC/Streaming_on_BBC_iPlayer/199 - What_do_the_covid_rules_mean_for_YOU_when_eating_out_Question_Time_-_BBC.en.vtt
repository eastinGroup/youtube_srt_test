00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
going to come under control
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.310 align:start position:0%
going to come under control
and<00:01:24.720><c> frankly</c><00:01:25.119><c> we</c><00:01:25.280><c> do</c><00:01:25.439><c> need</c><00:01:25.600><c> to</c><00:01:25.680><c> get</c><00:01:25.920><c> on</c><00:01:26.000><c> top</c><00:01:26.240><c> of</c>

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
and frankly we do need to get on top of
 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.590 align:start position:0%
and frankly we do need to get on top of
the<00:01:26.479><c> second</c><00:01:26.880><c> wave</c>

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
the second wave
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.710 align:start position:0%
the second wave
and<00:01:28.000><c> urgency</c><00:01:28.640><c> does</c><00:01:29.040><c> matter</c><00:01:30.079><c> um</c><00:01:30.320><c> and</c><00:01:30.400><c> so</c><00:01:30.560><c> we</c>

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
and urgency does matter um and so we
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.069 align:start position:0%
and urgency does matter um and so we
just<00:01:30.960><c> got</c><00:01:31.119><c> to</c><00:01:31.200><c> get</c><00:01:31.439><c> on</c><00:01:31.520><c> with</c><00:01:31.759><c> it</c>

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
just got to get on with it
 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.069 align:start position:0%
just got to get on with it

it<00:01:40.079><c> make</c><00:01:40.320><c> sense</c><00:01:40.720><c> then</c>

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
it make sense then
 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.710 align:start position:0%
it make sense then
