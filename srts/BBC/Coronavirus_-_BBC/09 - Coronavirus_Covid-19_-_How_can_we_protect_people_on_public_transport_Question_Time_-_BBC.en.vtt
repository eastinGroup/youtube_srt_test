they're isolated
 

00:09:48.199 --> 00:09:49.749 align:start position:0%

so<00:09:48.529><c> I</c><00:09:48.589><c> guess</c><00:09:48.739><c> listening</c><00:09:49.100><c> to</c><00:09:49.160><c> this</c><00:09:49.220><c> debate</c><00:09:49.519><c> is</c>

00:09:49.749 --> 00:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
so I guess listening to this debate is
 

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:51.129 align:start position:0%
so I guess listening to this debate is
it<00:09:49.939><c> safe</c><00:09:50.149><c> currently</c><00:09:50.600><c> to</c><00:09:50.779><c> go</c><00:09:50.869><c> on</c><00:09:50.989><c> public</c>

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:52.850 align:start position:0%

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.939 align:start position:0%

is<00:09:53.089><c> it</c><00:09:53.299><c> safe</c><00:09:53.509><c> to</c><00:09:53.689><c> open</c><00:09:53.749><c> schools</c><00:09:54.199><c> I</c><00:09:54.499><c> don't</c><00:09:54.739><c> think</c>

00:09:54.939 --> 00:09:54.949 align:start position:0%
is it safe to open schools I don't think
 

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:56.350 align:start position:0%
is it safe to open schools I don't think
so<00:09:55.100><c> because</c><00:09:55.279><c> we</c><00:09:55.519><c> don't</c><00:09:55.549><c> have</c><00:09:55.819><c> them</c><00:09:55.939><c> place</c><00:09:56.149><c> the</c>
