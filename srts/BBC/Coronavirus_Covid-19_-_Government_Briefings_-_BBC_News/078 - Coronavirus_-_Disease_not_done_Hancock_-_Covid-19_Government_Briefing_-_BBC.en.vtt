one of the good pieces of good news is
 

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
one of the good pieces of good news is
that<00:14:03.300><c> as</c><00:14:03.600><c> the</c><00:14:03.990><c> rate</c><00:14:04.379><c> of</c><00:14:04.410><c> incidence</c><00:14:05.220><c> of</c><00:14:05.459><c> new</c>

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:05.850 align:start position:0%
that as the rate of incidence of new
 

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.019 align:start position:0%
that as the rate of incidence of new
cases<00:14:06.420><c> comes</c><00:14:07.019><c> down</c><00:14:07.379><c> so</c><00:14:08.279><c> of</c><00:14:08.429><c> course</c><00:14:08.579><c> there</c><00:14:08.879><c> are</c>

00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:09.029 align:start position:0%
cases comes down so of course there are
 

00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:13.549 align:start position:0%
cases comes down so of course there are

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
incidence of disease has come down and
 

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.269 align:start position:0%
incidence of disease has come down and
so<00:14:23.639><c> so</c><00:14:24.480><c> actually</c><00:14:24.869><c> we</c><00:14:25.049><c> we</c><00:14:25.559><c> have</c><00:14:25.740><c> more</c><00:14:25.980><c> capacity</c>

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
