question<00:12:26.470><c> was</c><00:12:26.589><c> well</c><00:12:27.419><c> why</c><00:12:28.419><c> do</c><00:12:28.480><c> we</c><00:12:28.629><c> not</c>

00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:28.749 align:start position:0%
question was well why do we not
 

00:12:28.749 --> 00:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
question was well why do we not
measuring<00:12:29.199><c> death</c><00:12:29.410><c> toll</c><00:12:29.649><c> outside</c><00:12:30.189><c> hospitals</c>

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:31.410 align:start position:0%
measuring death toll outside hospitals
 

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
measuring death toll outside hospitals
and<00:12:32.410><c> the</c><00:12:32.499><c> answer</c><00:12:32.739><c> is</c><00:12:32.829><c> we</c><00:12:32.949><c> are</c><00:12:33.100><c> so</c><00:12:33.669><c> there</c><00:12:33.850><c> are</c>

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.910 align:start position:0%
and the answer is we are so there are
 

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.269 align:start position:0%
and the answer is we are so there are
two<00:12:34.059><c> separate</c><00:12:34.629><c> bits</c><00:12:35.559><c> of</c><00:12:35.739><c> information</c><00:12:36.189><c> that</c>
