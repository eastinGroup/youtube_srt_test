00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:48.450 align:start position:0%
R factor to rise and as a result of that
we<00:43:46.089><c> had</c><00:43:46.329><c> a</c><00:43:46.569><c> second</c><00:43:47.109><c> peak</c><00:43:47.319><c> so</c><00:43:47.890><c> I'm</c><00:43:47.979><c> just</c><00:43:48.219><c> saying</c>

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:48.460 align:start position:0%
we had a second peak so I'm just saying
