the employee themselves and i think
 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.550 align:start position:0%
the employee themselves and i think

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's a very fair way to approach this
 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.150 align:start position:0%
that's a very fair way to approach this
we're<00:05:06.720><c> all</c><00:05:06.880><c> in</c><00:05:07.039><c> this</c><00:05:07.199><c> together</c>

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
and that's the right way that this
 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.870 align:start position:0%
and that's the right way that this

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
scheme should operate and i think the
 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.230 align:start position:0%
scheme should operate and i think the
