00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:39.100 align:start position:0%
it's very very important that this is
 

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's very very important that this is

done slowly and it's done carefully and
 

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.070 align:start position:0%

it's also important that there's a
