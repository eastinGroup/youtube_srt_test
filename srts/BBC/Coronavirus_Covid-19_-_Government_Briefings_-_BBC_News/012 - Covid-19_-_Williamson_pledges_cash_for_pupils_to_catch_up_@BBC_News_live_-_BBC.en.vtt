with less need for interventions but i
 

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.110 align:start position:0%
with less need for interventions but i

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
for example we have
 

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.710 align:start position:0%
for example we have

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
a new variant and while we are

understanding that more um
 

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.069 align:start position:0%

then<00:34:28.800><c> obviously</c><00:34:29.280><c> taking</c><00:34:29.679><c> additional</c>

00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
then obviously taking additional
 

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:32.869 align:start position:0%
then obviously taking additional
precautions<00:34:31.040><c> uh</c><00:34:31.359><c> makes</c><00:34:31.599><c> sense</c><00:34:32.000><c> we</c><00:34:32.240><c> understand</c>

00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
precautions uh makes sense we understand
 

00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:36.869 align:start position:0%
precautions uh makes sense we understand
more<00:34:33.359><c> about</c><00:34:33.679><c> the</c><00:34:34.159><c> um</c><00:34:34.720><c> ability</c><00:34:35.440><c> for</c><00:34:35.760><c> aerosol</c>

00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
more about the um ability for aerosol
 

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:39.270 align:start position:0%
more about the um ability for aerosol
generation<00:34:37.440><c> and</c><00:34:37.520><c> transmission</c><00:34:38.720><c> so</c><00:34:38.879><c> that</c><00:34:39.119><c> is</c>

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
generation and transmission so that is
 

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.470 align:start position:0%
generation and transmission so that is
also<00:34:39.679><c> important</c>

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
also important
 

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.389 align:start position:0%
also important
so<00:34:40.720><c> things</c><00:34:40.960><c> i</c><00:34:41.040><c> think</c><00:34:41.280><c> have</c><00:34:41.440><c> moved</c><00:34:41.760><c> on</c><00:34:41.919><c> and</c><00:34:42.240><c> it</c>

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
so things i think have moved on and it
 

00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:44.069 align:start position:0%
so things i think have moved on and it
should<00:34:42.560><c> be</c><00:34:42.720><c> reassuring</c><00:34:43.440><c> to</c><00:34:43.599><c> know</c><00:34:43.760><c> that</c><00:34:43.919><c> we</c>

00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
should be reassuring to know that we
 

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:45.909 align:start position:0%
should be reassuring to know that we

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
look at the evidence and then
 

00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:48.149 align:start position:0%
look at the evidence and then
adjust<00:34:46.480><c> our</c><00:34:46.639><c> advice</c><00:34:47.040><c> accordingly</c><00:34:47.919><c> but</c><00:34:48.079><c> i</c>

00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
adjust our advice accordingly but i
 

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.589 align:start position:0%
adjust our advice accordingly but i
think<00:34:48.480><c> also</c><00:34:48.879><c> one</c><00:34:49.119><c> of</c><00:34:49.280><c> the</c>

00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
think also one of the
 

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.909 align:start position:0%
think also one of the
uh<00:34:49.839><c> things</c><00:34:50.079><c> here</c><00:34:50.320><c> if</c><00:34:50.639><c> if</c><00:34:50.800><c> testing</c><00:34:51.359><c> is</c><00:34:51.520><c> coming</c>

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh things here if if testing is coming
