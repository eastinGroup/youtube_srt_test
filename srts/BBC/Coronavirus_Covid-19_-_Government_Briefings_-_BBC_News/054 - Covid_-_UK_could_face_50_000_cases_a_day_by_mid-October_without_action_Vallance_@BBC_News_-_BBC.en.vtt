00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
that some of those antibodies are
 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.029 align:start position:0%
that some of those antibodies are

so-called neutralizing antibodies they

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
do indeed protect against the virus
 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.710 align:start position:0%
do indeed protect against the virus
we<00:07:20.400><c> also</c><00:07:20.880><c> know</c><00:07:22.160><c> that</c><00:07:22.319><c> they</c><00:07:22.639><c> fade</c><00:07:23.039><c> over</c><00:07:23.440><c> time</c>

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
we also know that they fade over time
 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.029 align:start position:0%
we also know that they fade over time
and<00:07:24.880><c> there</c><00:07:25.120><c> are</c><00:07:25.360><c> cases</c><00:07:26.000><c> of</c><00:07:26.080><c> people</c><00:07:26.400><c> becoming</c>

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
and there are cases of people becoming
 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.309 align:start position:0%
and there are cases of people becoming
re-infected

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
re-infected
 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:31.749 align:start position:0%
re-infected
so<00:07:28.479><c> this</c><00:07:28.800><c> is</c><00:07:28.960><c> not</c><00:07:29.199><c> an</c><00:07:29.440><c> absolute</c><00:07:30.080><c> protection</c>

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
so this is not an absolute protection
 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.230 align:start position:0%
so this is not an absolute protection
and<00:07:32.000><c> it</c><00:07:32.160><c> will</c><00:07:32.639><c> potentially</c><00:07:33.280><c> decrease</c><00:07:33.919><c> over</c>

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
and it will potentially decrease over
 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
and it will potentially decrease over
time

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%

what<00:07:36.240><c> we</c><00:07:36.479><c> see</c><00:07:37.120><c> is</c><00:07:37.360><c> that</c><00:07:37.680><c> something</c><00:07:38.240><c> under</c>

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
what we see is that something under
 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.870 align:start position:0%
what we see is that something under
eight<00:07:38.880><c> percent</c><00:07:39.280><c> of</c><00:07:39.360><c> the</c><00:07:39.520><c> population</c>

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
eight percent of the population
 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.110 align:start position:0%
eight percent of the population
have<00:07:41.120><c> been</c><00:07:41.360><c> infected</c><00:07:42.319><c> as</c><00:07:42.560><c> we</c><00:07:42.720><c> measure</c><00:07:42.960><c> the</c>

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
have been infected as we measure the
 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.070 align:start position:0%
have been infected as we measure the
antibodies

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
antibodies
 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.390 align:start position:0%
antibodies
so<00:07:44.319><c> about</c><00:07:44.560><c> eight</c><00:07:44.800><c> percent</c><00:07:45.680><c> so</c><00:07:45.919><c> three</c><00:07:46.080><c> million</c>

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
so about eight percent so three million
 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.510 align:start position:0%
so about eight percent so three million
or<00:07:46.560><c> so</c><00:07:46.800><c> people</c>

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
or so people
 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.510 align:start position:0%
or so people
may<00:07:47.759><c> have</c><00:07:47.840><c> been</c><00:07:48.479><c> infected</c><00:07:49.120><c> and</c><00:07:49.280><c> have</c>

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
may have been infected and have
 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.029 align:start position:0%
may have been infected and have
antibodies

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
antibodies
 

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
antibodies
it<00:07:51.199><c> means</c><00:07:51.520><c> that</c><00:07:51.680><c> the</c><00:07:51.919><c> vast</c><00:07:52.240><c> majority</c><00:07:52.879><c> of</c><00:07:53.120><c> us</c>

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
it means that the vast majority of us
 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.430 align:start position:0%
it means that the vast majority of us

does mean
 

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:09.350 align:start position:0%

that the vast majority of the population

that the vast majority of the population
