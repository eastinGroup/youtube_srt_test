00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:44.230 align:start position:0%
so the antibody tests the important
 

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
so the antibody tests the important

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:45.790 align:start position:0%
thing about these antibody tests is it's
 

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
thing about these antibody tests is it's
not<00:14:45.910><c> a</c><00:14:45.940><c> matter</c><00:14:46.180><c> of</c><00:14:46.300><c> dragging</c><00:14:46.780><c> your</c><00:14:46.870><c> feet</c><00:14:47.200><c> it's</c>

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:47.710 align:start position:0%
not a matter of dragging your feet it's
 

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
not a matter of dragging your feet it's
important<00:14:48.280><c> that</c><00:14:48.339><c> the</c><00:14:48.520><c> test</c><00:14:48.730><c> is</c><00:14:48.850><c> valid</c><00:14:49.060><c> that</c><00:14:49.360><c> it</c>

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:49.510 align:start position:0%
important that the test is valid that it
 

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.870 align:start position:0%
important that the test is valid that it
does<00:14:49.720><c> what</c><00:14:49.900><c> it</c><00:14:50.050><c> says</c><00:14:50.080><c> it</c><00:14:50.440><c> does</c><00:14:50.470><c> and</c><00:14:50.920><c> as</c><00:14:51.730><c> the</c>

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:55.450 align:start position:0%
something worse than no test is is a
 

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
something worse than no test is is a
wrong<00:14:55.900><c> test</c><00:14:56.260><c> or</c><00:14:56.500><c> a</c><00:14:56.530><c> bad</c><00:14:56.770><c> test</c><00:14:57.040><c> so</c><00:14:57.670><c> that</c><00:14:57.700><c> is</c><00:14:58.150><c> what</c>

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:58.510 align:start position:0%
wrong test or a bad test so that is what
