00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.430 align:start position:0%
what that feels like um but
i<00:09:54.800><c> think</c><00:09:54.959><c> that</c><00:09:55.279><c> daniel's</c><00:09:55.839><c> point</c><00:09:56.080><c> is</c><00:09:56.800><c> just</c><00:09:57.120><c> so</c>

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
i think that daniel's point is just so
 

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.630 align:start position:0%
i think that daniel's point is just so
important<00:09:58.080><c> which</c><00:09:58.320><c> is</c>

00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
of course legislation's important and
 

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.870 align:start position:0%
of course legislation's important and
