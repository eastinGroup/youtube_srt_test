they've<00:00:19.619><c> got</c><00:00:19.740><c> these</c><00:00:19.830><c> things</c><00:00:20.040><c> called</c><00:00:20.189><c> papillae</c>

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
they've got these things called papillae
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.249 align:start position:0%
they've got these things called papillae
which<00:00:20.790><c> made</c><00:00:21.330><c> out</c><00:00:21.450><c> of</c><00:00:21.570><c> keratin</c><00:00:21.779><c> on</c><00:00:22.110><c> their</c>

okay

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.330 align:start position:0%
okay
and<00:00:24.989><c> so</c><00:00:25.169><c> they</c><00:00:25.320><c> drink</c><00:00:25.739><c> the</c><00:00:25.800><c> water</c><00:00:25.950><c> and</c><00:00:26.099><c> almost</c>

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
and so they drink the water and almost
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
and so they drink the water and almost
serve<00:00:26.520><c> scratch</c><00:00:27.390><c> it</c><00:00:27.660><c> like</c><00:00:28.380><c> they</c><00:00:28.470><c> do</c><00:00:28.529><c> on</c><00:00:28.590><c> your</c>

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 align:start position:0%
serve scratch it like they do on your
 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
serve scratch it like they do on your
skin<00:00:28.950><c> and</c><00:00:29.099><c> scoop</c><00:00:29.430><c> it</c><00:00:29.579><c> up</c><00:00:29.730><c> without</c><00:00:29.939><c> actually</c>

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 align:start position:0%

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.310 align:start position:0%
skin and scoop it up without actually

breaking the surface of the water
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
breaking the surface of the water
whereas<00:00:31.770><c> dogs</c><00:00:32.009><c> do</c><00:00:32.189><c> it</c><00:00:32.279><c> completely</c>

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 align:start position:0%
whereas dogs do it completely
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
whereas dogs do it completely
differently<00:00:32.880><c> they</c><00:00:33.270><c> don't</c><00:00:33.450><c> have</c><00:00:33.540><c> this</c><00:00:33.690><c> of</c>

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 align:start position:0%
differently they don't have this of
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.139 align:start position:0%
differently they don't have this of
scratchy<00:00:34.470><c> tongue</c><00:00:34.770><c> they</c><00:00:35.370><c> sort</c><00:00:35.640><c> of</c><00:00:35.700><c> do</c><00:00:35.790><c> a</c><00:00:35.820><c> scoop</c>

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 align:start position:0%
scratchy tongue they sort of do a scoop
 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.490 align:start position:0%
scratchy tongue they sort of do a scoop
bucket<00:00:36.630><c> let's</c><00:00:36.780><c> see</c><00:00:36.899><c> what</c><00:00:37.020><c> the</c><00:00:37.110><c> difference</c><00:00:37.380><c> is</c>

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
bucket let's see what the difference is
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500 align:start position:0%
bucket let's see what the difference is
yeah<00:00:38.160><c> right</c><00:00:38.579><c> so</c><00:00:38.730><c> this</c><00:00:38.820><c> is</c><00:00:38.880><c> a</c><00:00:39.000><c> mirror</c><00:00:39.239><c> another</c>

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 align:start position:0%
yeah right so this is a mirror another
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
yeah right so this is a mirror another

that look at you pulls it amazing isn't
it<00:01:48.619><c> so</c><00:01:49.009><c> that's</c><00:01:49.219><c> always</c><00:01:49.340><c> hooks</c><00:01:49.610><c> on</c><00:01:49.789><c> that</c><00:01:49.819><c> tongue</c>

really sort of hooks it right isn't it
 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.490 align:start position:0%
really sort of hooks it right isn't it
that's<00:01:55.729><c> extraordinary</c><00:01:56.209><c> I</c><00:01:56.689><c> knew</c><00:01:57.319><c> how</c><00:01:57.470><c> it</c>

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 align:start position:0%
that's extraordinary I knew how it
 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's extraordinary I knew how it
worked<00:01:57.740><c> in</c><00:01:57.979><c> theory</c><00:01:58.250><c> but</c><00:01:58.429><c> never</c><00:01:58.610><c> has</c><00:01:58.700><c> he</c><00:01:58.729><c> seen</c>

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 align:start position:0%
worked in theory but never has he seen
 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
worked in theory but never has he seen
it<00:01:59.030><c> like</c><00:01:59.509><c> that</c><00:01:59.780><c> nowhere</c><00:02:00.259><c> near</c><00:02:00.439><c> as</c><00:02:00.530><c> good</c><00:02:00.649><c> as</c>

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 align:start position:0%
it like that nowhere near as good as
 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.380 align:start position:0%
it like that nowhere near as good as
that<00:02:00.920><c> and</c><00:02:01.399><c> you</c><00:02:01.490><c> can</c><00:02:01.610><c> see</c><00:02:01.759><c> he's</c><00:02:01.970><c> not</c><00:02:02.090><c> sort</c><00:02:02.329><c> of</c>

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 align:start position:0%
that and you can see he's not sort of
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
that and you can see he's not sort of
scooping<00:02:03.170><c> it</c><00:02:03.259><c> he's</c><00:02:03.380><c> going</c><00:02:03.560><c> just</c><00:02:03.860><c> along</c><00:02:04.130><c> the</c>

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 align:start position:0%
scooping it he's going just along the

scooping it he's going just along the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
surface and pulling it up so I reckon
 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.529 align:start position:0%
surface and pulling it up so I reckon
it's<00:02:07.759><c> probably</c><00:02:08.060><c> time</c><00:02:08.209><c> for</c><00:02:08.239><c> our</c><00:02:08.420><c> next</c>

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 align:start position:0%
it's probably time for our next
 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.569 align:start position:0%
it's probably time for our next
