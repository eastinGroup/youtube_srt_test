 transporting them out of the water is a complicated process that produces stress to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.280
 They are going to you is and that is why it is important to do it in the shortest time

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.590
 possible we developed a system to adapt manatees in

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.040
 some drawers and some containers in which they are totally tied to

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.870
 that they cannot move this means that we can reduce the risk that they

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.890
 can be hit or hurt on the move

 it's no use rescuing twenty fifty hundred manatees if people follow you

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.890
 unfortunately killing people in the Amazon has an ancestral culture of

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.540
 generation after generation of wildlife consumption and animal use

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.510
 As pets in the home, the work of changing the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.670
 minds of adults who have been raised that way but it is

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.680
 exceptionally exciting to see that work does work with children

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.830
 children have now become our main allies in the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.430
 conservation and the manatee has become an exceptional ally

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.010

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.530
 interest in finding out about the manatee find out what is happening to it what is its

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.540
 problem and how they can help the manatee and that is how to date we have

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.110

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.920

 That promise is that we will take care of you, we will feed you, we will protect you and

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.069
 when the time comes we will set you free

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.239
