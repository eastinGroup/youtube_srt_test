00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.010
 [Music]

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.219
 This festival is more important in the town during the year because they participate

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.140
 many people many people from outside other nations

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.160

 [Music and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.320
 and I started another 17-year-old nothing of his firecrackers

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.810
 I am now 67 years old and I am still in this tradition until

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.440
 I can't anymore, not yet

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.659
 a group like thieves and a group of muleteers

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.640
 thieves were practically the people who had a little more than

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.509
 resources at that time the thieves but they were dedicated to wanting

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.409
 rob these people so that for the people most in need

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:06.060
 I am proud of the tradition that has been generated for more than 400

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.730
 years suppose because my parents the parents of my parents and the grandparents of my

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.310
 parents already brought this tradition for me such a long time I will achieve

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:27.870
 it is not not to use it and I liked it because it was more action but thieves who did not come out

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.780
 previously some normal thunder was made to the thickness of my finger nothing more

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.670
 they had knowledge of two people who are currently here

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.170
 we know as generals

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:04.170
 of gunshot wars that were formerly in the ancestors

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.210
 [Music]

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.510

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.400
 to

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:49.640
 If you hit 5 firecrackers, the pressure is strong and you can fracture one hand

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.700
 that is [Music]

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:01.840
 the capitals of the image that we currently know are not against these

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.300
 of these detonations what happens is that we are against those of the

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.930
 mess ah

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.989
