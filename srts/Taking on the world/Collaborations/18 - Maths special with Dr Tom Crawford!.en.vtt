um river outflows and the ocean
 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.150 align:start position:0%
um river outflows and the ocean
so<00:02:44.319><c> the</c><00:02:44.480><c> idea</c><00:02:44.879><c> being</c><00:02:45.200><c> that</c><00:02:45.440><c> when</c><00:02:45.680><c> a</c><00:02:45.840><c> river</c>

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
so the idea being that when a river
 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.430 align:start position:0%
so the idea being that when a river
flows<00:02:46.480><c> into</c><00:02:46.720><c> the</c><00:02:46.879><c> ocean</c>

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
flows into the ocean
 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.150 align:start position:0%
flows into the ocean
you<00:02:47.599><c> have</c><00:02:47.840><c> fresh</c><00:02:48.160><c> water</c><00:02:49.120><c> from</c><00:02:49.360><c> the</c><00:02:49.519><c> river</c>

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
you have fresh water from the river
 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.710 align:start position:0%
you have fresh water from the river
which<00:02:50.480><c> is</c>

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
which is
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.070 align:start position:0%
which is
lighter<00:02:51.519><c> than</c><00:02:51.680><c> the</c><00:02:51.840><c> salt</c><00:02:52.160><c> water</c><00:02:52.720><c> in</c><00:02:52.800><c> the</c><00:02:53.040><c> ocean</c>

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
lighter than the salt water in the ocean
 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.150 align:start position:0%
lighter than the salt water in the ocean
and<00:02:54.239><c> so</c><00:02:54.480><c> there's</c><00:02:54.720><c> a</c><00:02:54.800><c> difference</c><00:02:55.120><c> of</c><00:02:55.360><c> buoyancy</c>

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
and so there's a difference of buoyancy
 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.910 align:start position:0%
and so there's a difference of buoyancy
which<00:02:56.480><c> creates</c><00:02:56.800><c> all</c><00:02:56.959><c> kinds</c><00:02:57.200><c> of</c><00:02:57.360><c> forces</c><00:02:57.840><c> and</c>

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
which creates all kinds of forces and

which creates all kinds of forces and

and then there was another tap supplied
 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
and then there was another tap supplied

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
salt water
 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.189 align:start position:0%

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
and this wasn't just any old about
 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.029 align:start position:0%
and this wasn't just any old about

a hundred times saltier than the ocean
 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.230 align:start position:0%
a hundred times saltier than the ocean
so<00:06:13.520><c> it</c><00:06:13.680><c> was</c><00:06:13.919><c> like</c><00:06:14.240><c> the</c><00:06:14.479><c> saltiest</c><00:06:15.280><c> salt</c><00:06:15.680><c> water</c>

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
so it was like the saltiest salt water
 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.870 align:start position:0%

um<00:08:52.640><c> so</c><00:08:52.800><c> i</c><00:08:52.959><c> so</c><00:08:53.120><c> i</c><00:08:53.440><c> spent</c><00:08:53.680><c> a</c><00:08:53.760><c> lot</c><00:08:53.839><c> of</c><00:08:53.920><c> my</c><00:08:54.080><c> time</c>

that's<00:08:56.000><c> in</c><00:08:56.240><c> some</c><00:08:56.399><c> way</c><00:08:56.640><c> you</c><00:08:56.720><c> can</c><00:08:56.800><c> think</c><00:08:56.959><c> of</c><00:08:57.040><c> that</c>

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's in some way you can think of that
 

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.710 align:start position:0%
that's in some way you can think of that

as perhaps half of my job
 

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.389 align:start position:0%
as perhaps half of my job
would<00:08:58.880><c> be</c><00:08:59.040><c> the</c><00:08:59.200><c> easiest</c><00:08:59.519><c> way</c><00:08:59.680><c> to</c><00:09:00.080><c> sort</c><00:09:00.240><c> of</c>

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
would be the easiest way to sort of
 

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:02.310 align:start position:0%
would be the easiest way to sort of
think<00:09:00.560><c> about</c><00:09:00.880><c> it</c><00:09:01.600><c> um</c>

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
think about it um
 

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
think about it um
and<00:09:02.399><c> then</c><00:09:02.560><c> when</c><00:09:02.720><c> i'm</c><00:09:02.880><c> not</c><00:09:03.120><c> teaching</c><00:09:04.160><c> so</c><00:09:04.399><c> my</c>

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then when i'm not teaching so my

and then when i'm not teaching so my

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
official title is i am a
 

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.509 align:start position:0%
official title is i am a

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.670 align:start position:0%
outreach
and<00:09:10.880><c> so</c><00:09:11.120><c> what</c><00:09:11.279><c> that</c><00:09:11.440><c> means</c><00:09:11.920><c> is</c><00:09:12.720><c> i</c><00:09:13.120><c> as</c><00:09:13.360><c> i</c><00:09:13.440><c> say</c>

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
and so what that means is i as i say
 

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.269 align:start position:0%
and so what that means is i as i say
approximately<00:09:14.160><c> half</c><00:09:14.399><c> my</c><00:09:14.560><c> time</c><00:09:14.880><c> is</c><00:09:14.959><c> spent</c>

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
approximately half my time is spent
 

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:15.829 align:start position:0%

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the other half is doing
 

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.829 align:start position:0%
and the other half is doing
communication<00:09:18.560><c> and</c><00:09:18.720><c> outreach</c><00:09:19.120><c> work</c><00:09:19.519><c> about</c>

00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%

so<00:09:21.920><c> in</c><00:09:22.080><c> a</c><00:09:22.640><c> normal</c><00:09:23.360><c> year</c><00:09:23.760><c> shall</c><00:09:24.000><c> we</c><00:09:24.080><c> say</c><00:09:24.240><c> or</c><00:09:24.399><c> in</c><00:09:24.560><c> a</c>

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
so in a normal year shall we say or in a
 

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.630 align:start position:0%
so in a normal year shall we say or in a

pre-coronavirus year
uh<00:09:26.800><c> that</c><00:09:26.959><c> would</c><00:09:27.120><c> be</c><00:09:27.279><c> lots</c><00:09:27.600><c> of</c><00:09:27.680><c> talks</c><00:09:28.000><c> in</c>

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh that would be lots of talks in
 

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.150 align:start position:0%
uh that would be lots of talks in
schools<00:09:28.880><c> yeah</c><00:09:29.200><c> so</c><00:09:29.600><c> um</c>

i<00:09:30.320><c> think</c><00:09:30.640><c> in</c><00:09:30.839><c> 2019</c><00:09:32.000><c> i</c><00:09:32.080><c> did</c><00:09:32.320><c> over</c><00:09:32.560><c> 100</c>

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
i think in 2019 i did over 100
 

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.230 align:start position:0%
i think in 2019 i did over 100
talks<00:09:33.839><c> in</c><00:09:33.920><c> schools</c><00:09:34.320><c> so</c><00:09:34.480><c> i'd</c><00:09:34.560><c> go</c><00:09:34.720><c> to</c><00:09:34.880><c> the</c><00:09:34.959><c> school</c>

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
talks in schools so i'd go to the school

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.350 align:start position:0%

i<00:11:16.320><c> could</c><00:11:16.480><c> have</c><00:11:16.560><c> carried</c><00:11:16.880><c> on</c><00:11:17.040><c> with</c><00:11:17.200><c> that</c>

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
i could have carried on with that
 

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.230 align:start position:0%
i could have carried on with that
project<00:11:18.560><c> yeah</c><00:11:18.880><c> so</c><00:11:19.120><c> so</c><00:11:19.279><c> i</c><00:11:19.600><c> reached</c><00:11:19.839><c> a</c><00:11:19.920><c> certain</c>

a very very large number of them will
 

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.590 align:start position:0%
a very very large number of them will
say<00:14:40.480><c> maths</c>

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
say maths
 

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.150 align:start position:0%
say maths
yeah<00:14:42.000><c> because</c><00:14:42.320><c> it</c><00:14:42.399><c> teaches</c><00:14:42.880><c> you</c><00:14:43.680><c> problem</c>

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
yeah because it teaches you problem
 

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.110 align:start position:0%
yeah because it teaches you problem
solving

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%

the<00:14:45.279><c> entire</c><00:14:47.519><c> maths</c><00:14:47.920><c> is</c><00:14:48.079><c> problem</c><00:14:48.399><c> solving</c>

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
the entire maths is problem solving
 

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.629 align:start position:0%
the entire maths is problem solving
it<00:14:49.279><c> is</c><00:14:50.160><c> logical</c><00:14:50.639><c> thinking</c><00:14:52.079><c> yeah</c>

00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
it is logical thinking yeah
 

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:54.629 align:start position:0%
it is logical thinking yeah
it<00:14:52.880><c> teaches</c><00:14:53.199><c> you</c><00:14:53.360><c> logical</c><00:14:53.760><c> thinking</c><00:14:54.240><c> so</c><00:14:54.480><c> so</c>

00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
it teaches you logical thinking so so
 

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:55.670 align:start position:0%
it teaches you logical thinking so so
when<00:14:54.800><c> you're</c><00:14:54.959><c> doing</c><00:14:55.279><c> like</c>

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
when you're doing like
 

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.069 align:start position:0%
when you're doing like
solving<00:14:56.000><c> a</c><00:14:56.079><c> math</c><00:14:56.399><c> problem</c><00:14:56.880><c> each</c><00:14:57.279><c> line</c><00:14:57.680><c> in</c><00:14:57.839><c> your</c>

00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
solving a math problem each line in your
 

00:14:58.079 --> 00:14:58.949 align:start position:0%
solving a math problem each line in your
solution

00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
solution
 

00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:01.030 align:start position:0%
solution
has<00:14:59.199><c> to</c><00:14:59.440><c> follow</c><00:14:59.839><c> from</c><00:15:00.000><c> the</c><00:15:00.079><c> one</c><00:15:00.399><c> before</c><00:15:00.800><c> it</c>

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
has to follow from the one before it
 

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
has to follow from the one before it
yeah

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.310 align:start position:0%
yeah
and<00:15:02.399><c> so</c><00:15:02.720><c> that's</c><00:15:02.880><c> like</c><00:15:03.040><c> logical</c><00:15:03.839><c> thinking</c>

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
and so that's like logical thinking
 

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
and so that's like logical thinking
deductions

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
deductions
 

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.069 align:start position:0%
deductions
and<00:15:05.600><c> things</c><00:15:06.320><c> so</c><00:15:07.120><c> i</c><00:15:07.279><c> think</c><00:15:07.519><c> and</c><00:15:07.680><c> then</c><00:15:07.760><c> it</c><00:15:07.839><c> also</c>

00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
and things so i think and then it also
 

00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:10.150 align:start position:0%
and things so i think and then it also
teaches<00:15:08.320><c> you</c><00:15:08.399><c> to</c><00:15:08.480><c> be</c><00:15:08.560><c> quite</c><00:15:08.800><c> creative</c>

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
teaches you to be quite creative
 

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.150 align:start position:0%
teaches you to be quite creative
this<00:15:10.399><c> is</c><00:15:10.560><c> something</c><00:15:10.880><c> that</c><00:15:11.120><c> i</c><00:15:11.199><c> think</c><00:15:11.600><c> not</c><00:15:11.839><c> many</c>

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
this is something that i think not many
