00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
think it it probably comes down to how
 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.899 align:start position:0%
think it it probably comes down to how

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 align:start position:0%
week but by Thursday well I think God
 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.300 align:start position:0%
week but by Thursday well I think God
I've<00:02:17.330><c> actually</c><00:02:17.480><c> got</c><00:02:17.750><c> a</c><00:02:17.780><c> rest</c><00:02:17.960><c> day</c><00:02:18.140><c> but</c><00:02:18.860><c> also</c><00:02:19.040><c> it</c>

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 align:start position:0%
I've actually got a rest day but also it
 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.830 align:start position:0%
I've actually got a rest day but also it
does<00:02:19.490><c> depend</c><00:02:19.850><c> on</c><00:02:19.940><c> how</c><00:02:20.000><c> well</c><00:02:20.270><c> you're</c><00:02:20.450><c> sleeping</c>

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
does depend on how well you're sleeping
 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
does depend on how well you're sleeping
because<00:02:21.230><c> if</c><00:02:21.500><c> you</c><00:02:21.590><c> don't</c><00:02:21.740><c> sleep</c><00:02:21.920><c> very</c><00:02:21.980><c> well</c>

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 align:start position:0%
because if you don't sleep very well
 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
because if you don't sleep very well
than<00:02:22.550><c> you</c><00:02:22.580><c> achy</c><00:02:22.820><c> even</c><00:02:23.180><c> more</c><00:02:23.360><c> yeah</c><00:02:23.780><c> and</c>

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 align:start position:0%
than you achy even more yeah and
 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
than you achy even more yeah and
probably<00:02:24.200><c> like</c><00:02:24.710><c> eating</c><00:02:25.220><c> and</c><00:02:25.340><c> nutrition</c><00:02:25.460><c> since</c>

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 align:start position:0%
probably like eating and nutrition since
 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
probably like eating and nutrition since
I<00:02:27.280><c> think</c><00:02:28.280><c> it</c><00:02:28.610><c> does</c><00:02:28.820><c> just</c><00:02:29.120><c> sometimes</c><00:02:29.570><c> like</c>

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 align:start position:0%
I think it does just sometimes like
 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.500 align:start position:0%
I think it does just sometimes like
sometimes<00:02:31.100><c> your</c><00:02:31.310><c> muscles</c><00:02:31.700><c> do</c><00:02:31.970><c> just</c><00:02:32.270><c> a</c><00:02:32.480><c> little</c>

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 align:start position:0%
sometimes your muscles do just a little
 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes your muscles do just a little
bit<00:02:32.960><c> more</c><00:02:33.290><c> one</c><00:02:33.680><c> week</c><00:02:33.920><c> than</c><00:02:34.160><c> they</c><00:02:34.280><c> do</c><00:02:34.340><c> the</c><00:02:34.580><c> next</c>

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 align:start position:0%
bit more one week than they do the next
 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.030 align:start position:0%
bit more one week than they do the next
week<00:02:35.000><c> yeah</c><00:02:35.450><c> because</c><00:02:36.050><c> it's</c><00:02:36.410><c> just</c><00:02:36.680><c> the</c><00:02:36.800><c> way</c><00:02:36.920><c> your</c>

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
week yeah because it's just the way your
 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
week yeah because it's just the way your
body<00:02:37.130><c> might</c><00:02:37.400><c> respond</c><00:02:37.790><c> to</c><00:02:37.910><c> the</c><00:02:38.000><c> exercises</c><00:02:38.720><c> yeah</c>

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 align:start position:0%

I<00:02:39.500><c> think</c><00:02:39.920><c> always</c><00:02:40.310><c> listen</c><00:02:41.090><c> to</c><00:02:41.390><c> your</c><00:02:41.750><c> body</c><00:02:41.990><c> in</c>

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
I think always listen to your body in
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.190 align:start position:0%
I think always listen to your body in

okay like today I had sore legs and I
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
okay like today I had sore legs and I
did<00:03:04.520><c> sprints</c><00:03:05.030><c> because</c><00:03:05.660><c> I</c><00:03:05.750><c> really</c><00:03:05.990><c> wanted</c><00:03:06.230><c> to</c>

did sprints because I really wanted to
 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.310 align:start position:0%
did sprints because I really wanted to
but<00:03:06.940><c> sometimes</c><00:03:07.940><c> that's</c><00:03:08.390><c> a</c><00:03:08.510><c> bit</c><00:03:08.660><c> risky</c><00:03:08.840><c> because</c>

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
but sometimes that's a bit risky because
 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.950 align:start position:0%
but sometimes that's a bit risky because
you<00:03:09.560><c> could</c><00:03:09.800><c> pull</c><00:03:10.130><c> something</c><00:03:10.550><c> and</c><00:03:10.670><c> then</c><00:03:10.880><c> yeah</c><00:03:11.600><c> I</c>

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
you could pull something and then yeah I
 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.540 align:start position:0%
you could pull something and then yeah I
think<00:03:12.140><c> scientifically</c><00:03:12.920><c> speaking</c><00:03:13.250><c> I</c><00:03:13.490><c> think</c>

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 align:start position:0%
think scientifically speaking I think
 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.190 align:start position:0%
think scientifically speaking I think
I've<00:03:13.760><c> heard</c><00:03:13.910><c> people</c><00:03:14.120><c> say</c><00:03:14.510><c> that</c><00:03:14.540><c> if</c><00:03:14.900><c> you</c><00:03:14.990><c> feel</c>

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 align:start position:0%

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 align:start position:0%
sore but you have rest differ I think
 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.290 align:start position:0%
sore but you have rest differ I think
it's<00:03:18.410><c> three</c><00:03:18.980><c> days</c><00:03:19.190><c> don't</c><00:03:19.730><c> quote</c><00:03:19.880><c> me</c><00:03:20.030><c> on</c><00:03:20.060><c> that</c><00:03:20.150><c> I</c>

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 align:start position:0%
it's three days don't quote me on that I
 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.150 align:start position:0%
it's three days don't quote me on that I
think<00:03:20.480><c> you</c><00:03:20.720><c> need</c><00:03:20.870><c> three</c><00:03:21.170><c> days</c><00:03:21.350><c> at</c><00:03:21.560><c> least</c><00:03:21.740><c> and</c>

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
think you need three days at least and
