00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
I mean when I watch these other videos
they<00:01:52.799><c> just</c><00:01:53.009><c> tell</c><00:01:53.159><c> you</c><00:01:53.369><c> use</c><00:01:53.700><c> the</c><00:01:53.880><c> equation</c><00:01:54.299><c> and</c>

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 align:start position:0%
they just tell you use the equation and
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.969 align:start position:0%
they just tell you use the equation and
then<00:01:54.780><c> subtract</c><00:01:55.320><c> one</c><00:01:55.470><c> percent</c><00:01:55.799><c> of</c><00:01:55.920><c> those</c>

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 align:start position:0%
then subtract one percent of those
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
then subtract one percent of those
calories<00:01:56.250><c> and</c><00:01:56.549><c> now</c><00:01:56.610><c> you're</c><00:01:56.790><c> cutting</c><00:01:56.969><c> all</c><00:01:57.240><c> the</c>
