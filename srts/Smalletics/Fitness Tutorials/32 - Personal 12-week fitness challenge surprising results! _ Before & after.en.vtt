00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
seeing fat loss pretty quickly and that
 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.710 align:start position:0%
seeing fat loss pretty quickly and that
kind<00:03:20.220><c> of</c><00:03:20.250><c> just</c><00:03:20.400><c> summarizes</c><00:03:20.940><c> the</c><00:03:21.060><c> last</c><00:03:21.300><c> you</c>

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
kind of just summarizes the last you

know the first six weeks maybe of this
challenge<00:03:24.420><c> was</c><00:03:24.660><c> just</c><00:03:24.690><c> literally</c><00:03:25.560><c> just</c>

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 align:start position:0%
challenge was just literally just

optimizing the lifestyle I already had
 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.110 align:start position:0%
optimizing the lifestyle I already had
it<00:03:28.200><c> was</c><00:03:28.350><c> because</c><00:03:28.860><c> it</c><00:03:29.040><c> was</c><00:03:29.160><c> already</c><00:03:29.370><c> pretty</c>

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
it was because it was already pretty
 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.580 align:start position:0%
it was because it was already pretty
healthy<00:03:30.450><c> at</c><00:03:30.540><c> the</c><00:03:30.660><c> time</c><00:03:30.870><c> and</c><00:03:31.110><c> it</c><00:03:31.200><c> just</c><00:03:31.410><c> really</c>

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 align:start position:0%
healthy at the time and it just really
 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
healthy at the time and it just really
came<00:03:31.770><c> down</c><00:03:31.800><c> to</c><00:03:31.950><c> okay</c><00:03:32.670><c> what</c><00:03:32.880><c> can</c><00:03:33.030><c> i</c><00:03:33.120><c> I'm</c><00:03:33.870><c> already</c>

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 align:start position:0%
came down to okay what can i I'm already
 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.290 align:start position:0%
came down to okay what can i I'm already
doing<00:03:34.200><c> a</c><00:03:34.380><c> lot</c><00:03:34.410><c> well</c><00:03:34.830><c> what</c><00:03:35.430><c> can</c><00:03:35.580><c> I</c><00:03:35.610><c> improve</c><00:03:36.030><c> on</c>

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 align:start position:0%

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:22.670 align:start position:0%
something that helped me just with

which<00:09:27.680><c> basically</c><00:09:28.010><c> just</c><00:09:28.130><c> means</c><00:09:28.339><c> that</c><00:09:28.730><c> I</c><00:09:28.970><c> ate</c>

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:29.330 align:start position:0%
which basically just means that I ate
 

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.150 align:start position:0%
which basically just means that I ate
higher<00:09:29.720><c> a</c><00:09:29.750><c> number</c><00:09:30.200><c> of</c><00:09:30.290><c> carbs</c><00:09:30.589><c> on</c><00:09:30.770><c> days</c><00:09:30.950><c> that</c><00:09:30.980><c> I</c>

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:36.290 align:start position:0%
that works really well for me I just
 

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
that works really well for me I just
