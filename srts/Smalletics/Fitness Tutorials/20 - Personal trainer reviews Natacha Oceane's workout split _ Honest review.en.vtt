00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:52.630 align:start position:0%
of reps mostly are between eight and
 

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
of reps mostly are between eight and
fifteen<00:13:52.840><c> reps</c><00:13:53.470><c> and</c><00:13:53.770><c> this</c><00:13:54.250><c> is</c><00:13:54.430><c> going</c><00:13:54.610><c> to</c><00:13:54.700><c> allow</c>

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.090 align:start position:0%
fifteen reps and this is going to allow
 

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.990 align:start position:0%
fifteen reps and this is going to allow
the<00:13:55.510><c> muscle</c><00:13:56.140><c> to</c><00:13:56.290><c> grow</c><00:13:56.620><c> this</c><00:13:57.280><c> is</c><00:13:57.490><c> totally</c>

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
the muscle to grow this is totally
 

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
the muscle to grow this is totally

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
really really good because it stimulates
 

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
really really good because it stimulates
the<00:14:02.620><c> muscles</c><00:14:02.950><c> to</c><00:14:03.070><c> grow</c><00:14:03.280><c> and</c><00:14:03.550><c> you'll</c><00:14:03.700><c> build</c>

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:03.970 align:start position:0%
the muscles to grow and you'll build
 

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
the muscles to grow and you'll build
muscle<00:14:04.450><c> and</c><00:14:04.720><c> no</c><00:14:05.050><c> he</c><00:14:05.200><c> will</c><00:14:05.380><c> not</c><00:14:05.500><c> build</c><00:14:05.830><c> muscle</c>

rep range and then your muscles start to
 

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
rep range and then your muscles start to
