00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:02.350 align:start position:0%
they find something that looks kind of
 

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
they find something that looks kind of
abnormal<00:11:02.770><c> they'll</c><00:11:03.010><c> take</c><00:11:03.220><c> a</c><00:11:03.250><c> biopsy</c><00:11:03.640><c> of</c><00:11:03.910><c> it</c><00:11:04.060><c> so</c>

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.210 align:start position:0%
abnormal they'll take a biopsy of it so
 

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
abnormal they'll take a biopsy of it so
they're<00:11:04.330><c> literally</c><00:11:04.540><c> like</c><00:11:04.630><c> snipping</c><00:11:05.350><c> a</c><00:11:05.590><c> piece</c>

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.370 align:start position:0%
they're literally like snipping a piece
 

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're literally like snipping a piece
off<00:11:06.520><c> right</c><00:11:06.820><c> so</c><00:11:07.150><c> I</c><00:11:07.180><c> actually</c><00:11:07.510><c> had</c><00:11:07.780><c> to</c><00:11:07.810><c> go</c>

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:07.930 align:start position:0%
off right so I actually had to go
 

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.330 align:start position:0%
off right so I actually had to go
through<00:11:08.020><c> this</c><00:11:08.140><c> procedure</c><00:11:08.320><c> and</c><00:11:08.920><c> I</c><00:11:09.220><c> was</c>

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:09.340 align:start position:0%
through this procedure and I was
 

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.780 align:start position:0%
through this procedure and I was
absolutely<00:11:09.610><c> mortified</c><00:11:10.120><c> terrified</c><00:11:10.870><c> so</c><00:11:11.410><c> scared</c>

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:11.790 align:start position:0%
absolutely mortified terrified so scared
 

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.370 align:start position:0%
absolutely mortified terrified so scared
came<00:11:12.790><c> back</c><00:11:12.910><c> completely</c><00:11:13.060><c> normal</c><00:11:13.330><c> first</c><00:11:13.930><c> false</c>

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:14.380 align:start position:0%
came back completely normal first false
 

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
came back completely normal first false
alarm<00:11:14.800><c> there</c><00:11:15.430><c> was</c><00:11:15.550><c> nothing</c><00:11:15.850><c> wrong</c><00:11:16.060><c> with</c>

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:16.450 align:start position:0%
alarm there was nothing wrong with
 

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.230 align:start position:0%
alarm there was nothing wrong with
anything<00:11:17.400><c> what</c><00:11:18.400><c> could</c><00:11:18.610><c> have</c><00:11:18.700><c> caused</c><00:11:19.030><c> the</c>

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
anything what could have caused the
 

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.730 align:start position:0%
anything what could have caused the
abnormal<00:11:19.660><c> test</c><00:11:19.870><c> in</c><00:11:20.050><c> the</c><00:11:20.110><c> first</c><00:11:20.230><c> place</c><00:11:20.470><c> was</c>

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:20.740 align:start position:0%
abnormal test in the first place was
 

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
abnormal test in the first place was
using<00:11:21.280><c> tampons</c><00:11:21.760><c> too</c><00:11:22.000><c> close</c><00:11:22.240><c> to</c><00:11:22.540><c> my</c><00:11:22.690><c> pap</c><00:11:22.870><c> smear</c>

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:23.230 align:start position:0%
using tampons too close to my pap smear
 

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.610 align:start position:0%
using tampons too close to my pap smear
um<00:11:23.560><c> and</c><00:11:24.040><c> so</c><00:11:24.490><c> I</c><00:11:24.820><c> thought</c><00:11:25.660><c> that</c><00:11:25.900><c> that</c><00:11:25.930><c> was</c><00:11:26.260><c> it</c><00:11:26.410><c> so</c>

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:26.620 align:start position:0%
um and so I thought that that was it so
 

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.540 align:start position:0%
um and so I thought that that was it so
for<00:11:27.160><c> the</c><00:11:27.430><c> year</c><00:11:27.610><c> after</c><00:11:27.880><c> that</c><00:11:28.090><c> I</c><00:11:28.450><c> just</c><00:11:28.750><c> tried</c><00:11:28.930><c> to</c>

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:29.550 align:start position:0%
for the year after that I just tried to
 

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
for the year after that I just tried to
see<00:11:30.550><c> the</c><00:11:30.700><c> gyno</c><00:11:31.590><c> like</c><00:11:32.590><c> with</c><00:11:33.160><c> you</c><00:11:33.370><c> know</c><00:11:33.400><c> at</c><00:11:33.700><c> a</c>

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:33.730 align:start position:0%
see the gyno like with you know at a
 

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
see the gyno like with you know at a
time<00:11:33.820><c> that</c><00:11:34.210><c> wasn't</c><00:11:34.390><c> right</c><00:11:34.660><c> after</c><00:11:34.900><c> my</c><00:11:34.960><c> period</c>

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:35.350 align:start position:0%
time that wasn't right after my period
 

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
time that wasn't right after my period
however<00:11:35.700><c> last</c><00:11:36.700><c> year</c><00:11:36.880><c> I</c><00:11:37.210><c> did</c><00:11:37.390><c> another</c><00:11:37.570><c> pap</c>

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:37.810 align:start position:0%
however last year I did another pap
 

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.810 align:start position:0%
however last year I did another pap
smear<00:11:38.140><c> and</c><00:11:38.410><c> it</c><00:11:38.470><c> came</c><00:11:38.620><c> back</c><00:11:38.830><c> abnormal</c><00:11:39.130><c> again</c>

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:39.820 align:start position:0%
smear and it came back abnormal again
 

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
smear and it came back abnormal again
and<00:11:40.150><c> I</c><00:11:40.690><c> was</c><00:11:40.960><c> super</c><00:11:41.560><c> frustrated</c><00:11:42.100><c> and</c><00:11:42.250><c> super</c>

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:42.550 align:start position:0%
and I was super frustrated and super
 

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.550 align:start position:0%
and I was super frustrated and super
scared<00:11:42.820><c> and</c><00:11:43.090><c> at</c><00:11:43.630><c> this</c><00:11:43.720><c> point</c><00:11:43.990><c> I</c><00:11:44.170><c> had</c><00:11:44.260><c> actually</c>

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%

abnormal cells on their cervix and had
 

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.110 align:start position:0%
abnormal cells on their cervix and had
to<00:11:56.220><c> basically</c><00:11:57.220><c> move</c><00:11:57.670><c> forward</c><00:11:57.970><c> with</c><00:11:58.060><c> the</c>

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
to basically move forward with the
 

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.540 align:start position:0%
to basically move forward with the
procedures<00:11:58.480><c> either</c><00:11:58.750><c> freeze</c><00:11:58.930><c> them</c><00:11:59.080><c> off</c><00:11:59.200><c> or</c>

00:11:59.540 --> 00:11:59.550 align:start position:0%
procedures either freeze them off or
 

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:04.170 align:start position:0%
procedures either freeze them off or
remove<00:12:00.550><c> part</c><00:12:00.820><c> of</c><00:12:00.880><c> cervix</c><00:12:01.260><c> and</c><00:12:02.260><c> so</c><00:12:03.250><c> at</c><00:12:04.030><c> this</c>

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:04.180 align:start position:0%
remove part of cervix and so at this
 

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.610 align:start position:0%
remove part of cervix and so at this
point<00:12:04.360><c> I</c><00:12:04.450><c> felt</c><00:12:04.690><c> so</c><00:12:04.870><c> much</c><00:12:04.930><c> more</c><00:12:05.350><c> comfortable</c>
