00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
cardio i'm ready to do this and strength
 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.550 align:start position:0%
cardio i'm ready to do this and strength
training<00:01:26.240><c> is</c>

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
training is
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.630 align:start position:0%
training is
really<00:01:26.960><c> what</c><00:01:27.200><c> i</c><00:01:27.360><c> needed</c><00:01:27.759><c> to</c><00:01:27.920><c> be</c><00:01:28.080><c> doing</c><00:01:28.560><c> in</c>

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
really what i needed to be doing in
 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.069 align:start position:0%
really what i needed to be doing in
order<00:01:28.960><c> to</c><00:01:29.119><c> build</c><00:01:29.520><c> muscle</c>

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
order to build muscle
 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.510 align:start position:0%
order to build muscle
so<00:01:30.240><c> that</c><00:01:30.400><c> i</c><00:01:30.479><c> could</c><00:01:30.720><c> have</c><00:01:30.960><c> that</c><00:01:31.119><c> tone</c><00:01:31.439><c> and</c>

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
so that i could have that tone and
 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.830 align:start position:0%
so that i could have that tone and
definition<00:01:32.560><c> for</c><00:01:32.799><c> me</c><00:01:33.040><c> i</c><00:01:33.200><c> wanted</c><00:01:33.439><c> to</c><00:01:33.600><c> look</c>

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
definition for me i wanted to look
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.469 align:start position:0%
definition for me i wanted to look
really

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
really
 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.870 align:start position:0%
really
toned<00:01:35.040><c> and</c><00:01:35.360><c> in</c><00:01:35.600><c> shape</c><00:01:35.920><c> and</c><00:01:36.079><c> what</c><00:01:36.240><c> i</c><00:01:36.400><c> did</c><00:01:36.640><c> not</c>

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
toned and in shape and what i did not
 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.429 align:start position:0%
toned and in shape and what i did not
understand<00:01:37.360><c> back</c><00:01:37.520><c> then</c><00:01:37.759><c> was</c><00:01:37.920><c> that</c><00:01:38.159><c> that</c><00:01:38.479><c> tone</c>

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
understand back then was that that tone
 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.990 align:start position:0%
understand back then was that that tone
comes<00:01:39.840><c> from</c><00:01:40.320><c> muscle</c><00:01:40.799><c> and</c><00:01:40.960><c> you</c><00:01:41.280><c> have</c><00:01:41.520><c> to</c><00:01:41.680><c> lift</c>

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
comes from muscle and you have to lift
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.550 align:start position:0%
comes from muscle and you have to lift
weights<00:01:42.399><c> in</c><00:01:42.479><c> order</c><00:01:42.799><c> to</c><00:01:43.040><c> have</c><00:01:43.280><c> that</c><00:01:43.520><c> muscular</c>

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
weights in order to have that muscular
 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.789 align:start position:0%
weights in order to have that muscular
tone<00:01:44.880><c> and</c><00:01:45.040><c> you</c><00:01:45.119><c> don't</c><00:01:45.280><c> have</c><00:01:45.360><c> to</c><00:01:45.520><c> look</c><00:01:45.759><c> bulky</c><00:01:46.240><c> or</c>

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
tone and you don't have to look bulky or
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.230 align:start position:0%
tone and you don't have to look bulky or

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
muscular
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.910 align:start position:0%
muscular
you<00:01:48.640><c> just</c><00:01:48.880><c> need</c><00:01:49.040><c> to</c><00:01:49.200><c> lift</c><00:01:49.360><c> weights</c><00:01:49.600><c> so</c><00:01:49.680><c> you</c><00:01:49.759><c> can</c>

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
you just need to lift weights so you can
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.590 align:start position:0%
you just need to lift weights so you can
have<00:01:50.079><c> a</c><00:01:50.159><c> little</c><00:01:50.320><c> bit</c><00:01:50.479><c> of</c><00:01:50.640><c> muscle</c><00:01:51.040><c> so</c><00:01:51.200><c> that</c>

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of muscle so that
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.789 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of muscle so that
you<00:01:51.759><c> can</c><00:01:52.000><c> actually</c><00:01:52.640><c> have</c><00:01:52.960><c> that</c><00:01:54.079><c> toned</c><00:01:54.479><c> look</c>

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
you can actually have that toned look
 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:55.270 align:start position:0%
you can actually have that toned look
and<00:01:54.880><c> look</c>

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
and look
 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.230 align:start position:0%
and look
more<00:01:56.079><c> curvier</c><00:01:56.640><c> as</c><00:01:56.880><c> i</c><00:01:57.040><c> guess</c><00:01:57.600><c> you</c><00:01:57.759><c> know</c><00:01:58.079><c> it</c>

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
more curvier as i guess you know it
 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.830 align:start position:0%
more curvier as i guess you know it
helps<00:01:58.560><c> add</c><00:01:58.799><c> curves</c><00:01:59.119><c> but</c><00:01:59.280><c> also</c>

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
helps add curves but also
 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.190 align:start position:0%
helps add curves but also
definition<00:02:00.960><c> so</c><00:02:01.840><c> then</c><00:02:02.240><c> that</c><00:02:02.560><c> number</c><00:02:02.799><c> one</c><00:02:03.040><c> thing</c>

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
definition so then that number one thing
 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.190 align:start position:0%
definition so then that number one thing
or<00:02:03.360><c> number</c><00:02:03.680><c> 10</c><00:02:04.000><c> would</c><00:02:04.159><c> be</c><00:02:04.320><c> on</c><00:02:04.479><c> the</c><00:02:04.640><c> list</c>

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
or number 10 would be on the list
 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.070 align:start position:0%
or number 10 would be on the list
was<00:02:05.600><c> i</c><00:02:06.079><c> wish</c><00:02:06.399><c> i</c><00:02:06.479><c> had</c><00:02:06.799><c> skipped</c><00:02:07.439><c> all</c><00:02:07.600><c> those</c><00:02:07.759><c> years</c>

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
of weights thinking that
 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.110 align:start position:0%
of weights thinking that

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
and this was back before weights were

and this was back before weights were
cool<00:02:23.920><c> i</c><00:02:24.000><c> feel</c><00:02:24.160><c> like</c><00:02:24.239><c> weights</c><00:02:24.480><c> are</c><00:02:24.560><c> a</c><00:02:24.640><c> little</c>

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
but weights and strength training is
 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.070 align:start position:0%

definitely<00:02:28.720><c> the</c><00:02:28.879><c> way</c><00:02:29.200><c> to</c><00:02:29.360><c> get</c><00:02:29.520><c> started</c><00:02:29.920><c> if</c>

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 align:start position:0%

for<00:10:41.680><c> example</c><00:10:42.079><c> you</c><00:10:42.160><c> can't</c><00:10:42.399><c> diet</c><00:10:42.720><c> forever</c><00:10:43.120><c> so</c>
