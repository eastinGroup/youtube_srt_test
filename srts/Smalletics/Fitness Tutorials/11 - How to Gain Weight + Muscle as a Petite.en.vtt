okay the last step and it's kind of
feeds<00:12:10.420><c> into</c><00:12:10.569><c> this</c><00:12:10.720><c> what</c><00:12:10.929><c> I</c><00:12:10.959><c> was</c><00:12:11.110><c> saying</c><00:12:11.290><c> was</c>

00:12:12.049 --> 00:12:12.059 align:start position:0%
feeds into this what I was saying was
 

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
feeds into this what I was saying was
after<00:12:13.059><c> you</c><00:12:13.149><c> put</c><00:12:13.329><c> on</c><00:12:13.389><c> all</c><00:12:13.569><c> this</c><00:12:13.660><c> muscle</c><00:12:13.929><c> you</c>

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:14.350 align:start position:0%
after you put on all this muscle you
 

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.989 align:start position:0%
after you put on all this muscle you
will<00:12:14.619><c> have</c><00:12:14.829><c> increased</c><00:12:15.279><c> your</c><00:12:15.339><c> metabolism</c>

00:12:15.989 --> 00:12:15.999 align:start position:0%
will have increased your metabolism
 

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:17.489 align:start position:0%

00:12:17.489 --> 00:12:17.499 align:start position:0%
because it takes more calories to burn
 

00:12:17.499 --> 00:12:20.309 align:start position:0%
because it takes more calories to burn
muscle<00:12:18.369><c> sorry</c><00:12:19.119><c> it</c><00:12:19.300><c> takes</c><00:12:19.509><c> more</c><00:12:19.809><c> calories</c><00:12:19.990><c> to</c>

00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
muscle sorry it takes more calories to
 

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:23.309 align:start position:0%
