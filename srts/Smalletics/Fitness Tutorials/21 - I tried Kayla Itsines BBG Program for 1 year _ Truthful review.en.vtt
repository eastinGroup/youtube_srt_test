00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:52.430 align:start position:0%
to go about this and that's how I went
 

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.769 align:start position:0%
to go about this and that's how I went
about<00:12:52.640><c> it</c><00:12:52.700><c> if</c><00:12:52.940><c> you</c><00:12:53.029><c> know</c><00:12:53.180><c> me</c><00:12:53.329><c> you</c><00:12:53.450><c> know</c><00:12:53.480><c> I</c><00:12:53.570><c> went</c>

00:12:53.769 --> 00:12:53.779 align:start position:0%
about it if you know me you know I went
 

00:12:53.779 --> 00:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
about it if you know me you know I went
down<00:12:53.870><c> that</c><00:12:54.110><c> road</c><00:12:54.290><c> for</c><00:12:54.500><c> many</c><00:12:54.589><c> years</c><00:12:54.910><c> so</c><00:12:55.910><c> I</c>

00:12:56.319 --> 00:12:56.329 align:start position:0%
down that road for many years so I
 

00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
down that road for many years so I
actually<00:12:56.540><c> lost</c><00:12:56.870><c> muscle</c><00:12:57.140><c> pretty</c><00:12:57.529><c> much</c>

00:12:57.639 --> 00:12:57.649 align:start position:0%
actually lost muscle pretty much
 

00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:00.069 align:start position:0%

everywhere except for my legs and the
 

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.420 align:start position:0%
everywhere except for my legs and the
reason<00:13:00.440><c> why</c><00:13:00.560><c> is</c><00:13:00.620><c> because</c><00:13:00.800><c> it</c><00:13:01.100><c> was</c><00:13:01.250><c> all</c>

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:01.430 align:start position:0%
reason why is because it was all
 

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.850 align:start position:0%
reason why is because it was all
plyometrics<00:13:02.270><c> which</c><00:13:02.839><c> is</c><00:13:03.110><c> light</c><00:13:03.380><c> work</c><00:13:03.620><c> so</c>

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:03.860 align:start position:0%
plyometrics which is light work so
 

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
plyometrics which is light work so
you're<00:13:04.040><c> jumping</c><00:13:04.550><c> seven</c><00:13:04.970><c> days</c><00:13:05.120><c> a</c><00:13:05.150><c> week</c><00:13:05.300><c> you're</c>

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:05.810 align:start position:0%
you're jumping seven days a week you're

this<00:13:09.830><c> is</c><00:13:10.100><c> going</c><00:13:10.279><c> to</c><00:13:10.459><c> cause</c><00:13:10.670><c> your</c><00:13:10.820><c> lights</c><00:13:11.060><c> to</c>

00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:11.269 align:start position:0%
this is going to cause your lights to
 

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:13.900 align:start position:0%
this is going to cause your lights to
retain<00:13:11.810><c> the</c><00:13:12.019><c> muscle</c><00:13:12.320><c> and</c><00:13:12.500><c> grow</c><00:13:12.769><c> the</c><00:13:12.950><c> muscle</c><00:13:13.279><c> so</c>

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:13.910 align:start position:0%
retain the muscle and grow the muscle so
 

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.370 align:start position:0%
