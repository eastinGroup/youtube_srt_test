00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.250 align:start position:0%
doesn't make you a failure it just makes
 

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't make you a failure it just makes

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
this a journey right and that's why it's
 

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.050 align:start position:0%
this a journey right and that's why it's

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:14.030 align:start position:0%
so there's steps forward and that's
 

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.820 align:start position:0%
so there's steps forward and that's
