00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
muscle that is by nature catabolic which
 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.099 align:start position:0%
muscle that is by nature catabolic which

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 align:start position:0%
means you're breaking down tissue I knew
 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.779 align:start position:0%
means you're breaking down tissue I knew
that<00:04:18.289><c> I</c><00:04:18.320><c> would</c><00:04:18.470><c> have</c><00:04:18.500><c> to</c><00:04:18.769><c> be</c><00:04:18.889><c> in</c><00:04:19.039><c> a</c><00:04:19.130><c> deficit</c><00:04:19.609><c> I'd</c>

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 align:start position:0%
that I would have to be in a deficit I'd
 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.939 align:start position:0%
that I would have to be in a deficit I'd

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 align:start position:0%
have to eat a lot fewer calories and I
 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.860 align:start position:0%
have to eat a lot fewer calories and I
was<00:04:22.100><c> used</c><00:04:22.310><c> to</c><00:04:22.430><c> and</c><00:04:22.789><c> if</c><00:04:23.180><c> you</c><00:04:23.270><c> guys</c><00:04:23.360><c> watching</c><00:04:23.750><c> any</c>

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 align:start position:0%
was used to and if you guys watching any
 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
was used to and if you guys watching any
of<00:04:23.930><c> my</c><00:04:23.990><c> videos</c><00:04:24.050><c> you</c><00:04:24.410><c> know</c><00:04:24.680><c> that</c><00:04:24.830><c> when</c><00:04:24.949><c> you</c><00:04:25.070><c> eat</c>

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
of my videos you know that when you eat
 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.650 align:start position:0%
of my videos you know that when you eat
less<00:04:25.580><c> calories</c><00:04:25.760><c> you</c><00:04:26.060><c> actually</c><00:04:26.389><c> slow</c><00:04:26.600><c> the</c>

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 align:start position:0%
less calories you actually slow the
 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.620 align:start position:0%
less calories you actually slow the
metabolism<00:04:27.380><c> so</c><00:04:27.710><c> this</c><00:04:27.889><c> wasn't</c><00:04:28.070><c> just</c><00:04:28.250><c> a</c><00:04:28.580><c> like</c><00:04:29.449><c> a</c>

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 align:start position:0%
metabolism so this wasn't just a like a
 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.150 align:start position:0%

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 align:start position:0%
more cardio this was an intentional okay
 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.469 align:start position:0%
more cardio this was an intentional okay
I'm<00:04:34.190><c> going</c><00:04:34.490><c> to</c><00:04:34.610><c> be</c><00:04:34.729><c> slowing</c><00:04:34.970><c> down</c><00:04:35.060><c> my</c>

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be slowing down my

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 align:start position:0%
metabolism a little bit to break down
 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%

and<00:04:38.479><c> get</c><00:04:39.110><c> rid</c><00:04:39.260><c> of</c><00:04:39.380><c> some</c><00:04:39.560><c> of</c><00:04:39.590><c> the</c><00:04:39.680><c> muscle</c><00:04:39.979><c> and</c>

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 align:start position:0%
and get rid of some of the muscle and
 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.620 align:start position:0%
and get rid of some of the muscle and
then<00:04:40.430><c> afterwards</c><00:04:41.000><c> I'm</c><00:04:41.150><c> gonna</c><00:04:41.330><c> have</c><00:04:41.479><c> to</c>

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.090 align:start position:0%
in a short amount of time I really
 

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
in a short amount of time I really
wanted<00:12:02.270><c> to</c><00:12:02.360><c> do</c><00:12:02.450><c> it</c><00:12:02.570><c> right</c><00:12:02.780><c> and</c><00:12:03.220><c> rebalance</c><00:12:04.220><c> my</c>

I was able to speed up the metabolism
 

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
I was able to speed up the metabolism
tremendously<00:14:12.290><c> so</c><00:14:12.710><c> my</c><00:14:13.070><c> metabolism</c><00:14:13.400><c> your</c>

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:13.850 align:start position:0%
tremendously so my metabolism your
 

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.660 align:start position:0%
tremendously so my metabolism your

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.590 align:start position:0%
metabolism is not static you can change

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
it so my new metabolism my new BMR was
 

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.570 align:start position:0%
it so my new metabolism my new BMR was
actually<00:14:21.170><c> about</c><00:14:21.350><c> 2,000</c><00:14:21.920><c> calories</c><00:14:22.340><c> I</c><00:14:22.430><c> had</c>
