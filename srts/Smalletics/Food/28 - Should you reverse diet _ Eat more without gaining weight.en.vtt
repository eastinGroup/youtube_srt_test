00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
good to do that and it wouldn't
 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:24.469 align:start position:0%
good to do that and it wouldn't
necessarily<00:07:23.759><c> help</c><00:07:24.000><c> you</c>

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.350 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do with it

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
so that you don't just store it as fat
 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.950 align:start position:0%
so that you don't just store it as fat
if<00:07:51.599><c> you</c><00:07:51.759><c> suddenly</c><00:07:52.160><c> increase</c><00:07:52.400><c> your</c><00:07:52.560><c> calories</c>

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
by a lot
 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.070 align:start position:0%
by a lot
you<00:07:54.240><c> will</c><00:07:54.479><c> likely</c><00:07:54.879><c> store</c><00:07:55.120><c> it</c><00:07:55.199><c> as</c><00:07:55.440><c> excess</c><00:07:55.840><c> fat</c>

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
you will likely store it as excess fat
 

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.749 align:start position:0%
you will likely store it as excess fat
so<00:07:56.319><c> it's</c><00:07:56.560><c> really</c><00:07:56.879><c> key</c><00:07:57.120><c> that</c><00:07:57.280><c> you</c><00:07:57.440><c> give</c><00:07:57.599><c> your</c>

00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
so it's really key that you give your

00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%

slowly decrease that because our body

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
burning up calories through cardio and

burning up calories through cardio and
we<00:10:40.160><c> get</c><00:10:40.320><c> more</c><00:10:40.480><c> and</c><00:10:40.640><c> more</c><00:10:40.800><c> efficient</c><00:10:41.279><c> so</c><00:10:41.440><c> we'll</c>

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
we get more and more efficient so we'll
 

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.230 align:start position:0%
we get more and more efficient so we'll

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
do so if you eat fewer calories and do
 

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
do so if you eat fewer calories and do
more<00:10:50.480><c> cardio</c>

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
more cardio
 

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.710 align:start position:0%
more cardio
you<00:10:51.360><c> will</c><00:10:51.440><c> start</c><00:10:51.680><c> to</c><00:10:51.760><c> become</c><00:10:52.079><c> efficient</c><00:10:52.560><c> at</c>

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
you will start to become efficient at
 

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.310 align:start position:0%
you will start to become efficient at
that<00:10:52.959><c> and</c><00:10:53.120><c> you</c><00:10:53.200><c> won't</c><00:10:53.360><c> get</c><00:10:53.519><c> as</c><00:10:53.680><c> great</c><00:10:53.920><c> results</c>

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
that and you won't get as great results
 

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
that and you won't get as great results
with<00:10:54.560><c> it</c>

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
with it
 

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.230 align:start position:0%
with it
and<00:10:54.880><c> that's</c><00:10:55.040><c> why</c><00:10:55.200><c> you</c><00:10:55.360><c> need</c><00:10:55.519><c> to</c><00:10:55.680><c> restore</c><00:10:56.079><c> your</c>

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
and that's why you need to restore your
 

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.470 align:start position:0%
and that's why you need to restore your
metabolism<00:10:56.880><c> with</c><00:10:56.959><c> a</c><00:10:57.040><c> reverse</c><00:10:57.440><c> diet</c>

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
metabolism with a reverse diet
 

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
metabolism with a reverse diet
so<00:10:58.800><c> if</c><00:10:58.959><c> you're</c><00:10:59.279><c> doing</c><00:10:59.600><c> cardio</c><00:11:00.720><c> for</c><00:11:01.040><c> two</c><00:11:01.360><c> hours</c>

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
so if you're doing cardio for two hours
 

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
so if you're doing cardio for two hours
every<00:11:02.320><c> day</c><00:11:02.720><c> start</c><00:11:02.959><c> to</c><00:11:03.120><c> taper</c><00:11:03.440><c> it</c><00:11:03.600><c> back</c><00:11:03.920><c> add</c><00:11:04.160><c> in</c>

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
every day start to taper it back add in
 

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.430 align:start position:0%
every day start to taper it back add in
a<00:11:04.480><c> rest</c><00:11:04.800><c> day</c>

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
a rest day
 

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.269 align:start position:0%
a rest day
don't<00:11:05.680><c> stop</c><00:11:06.000><c> all</c><00:11:06.160><c> at</c><00:11:06.320><c> once</c><00:11:06.640><c> because</c><00:11:06.959><c> like</c><00:11:07.120><c> i</c>

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
don't stop all at once because like i
 

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.110 align:start position:0%
don't stop all at once because like i
said<00:11:07.600><c> you</c><00:11:07.760><c> have</c><00:11:07.839><c> a</c><00:11:07.920><c> higher</c><00:11:08.240><c> chance</c><00:11:08.560><c> of</c>

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
said you have a higher chance of
 

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.670 align:start position:0%
said you have a higher chance of

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
eating fat faster if you do that but if

eating fat faster if you do that but if
you<00:11:11.760><c> do</c><00:11:11.920><c> it</c><00:11:12.000><c> really</c><00:11:12.320><c> slow</c>

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
you do it really slow
 

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.350 align:start position:0%
you do it really slow
then<00:11:13.360><c> you'll</c><00:11:13.600><c> have</c><00:11:14.000><c> better</c><00:11:14.320><c> outcomes</c>

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.269 align:start position:0%

you're going a more intuitive approach
or<00:11:42.399><c> maybe</c><00:11:42.880><c> using</c><00:11:43.200><c> the</c><00:11:43.360><c> palm</c><00:11:43.680><c> method</c><00:11:44.160><c> with</c><00:11:44.320><c> your</c>

then<00:11:48.320><c> you'll</c><00:11:48.560><c> know</c><00:11:49.600><c> if</c><00:11:49.760><c> you</c><00:11:49.839><c> do</c><00:11:50.000><c> a</c><00:11:50.079><c> food</c>

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
carbohydrate intake we store more water
 

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.269 align:start position:0%
carbohydrate intake we store more water

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
so one gram of carbohydrate stores three
 

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:55.030 align:start position:0%
