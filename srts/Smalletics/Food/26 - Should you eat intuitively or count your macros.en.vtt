again that's sort of like number one
 

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.030 align:start position:0%
again that's sort of like number one
with<00:09:55.680><c> just</c><00:09:55.920><c> you</c><00:09:56.080><c> learn</c><00:09:56.320><c> what</c><00:09:56.480><c> a</c><00:09:56.560><c> protein</c><00:09:56.880><c> fat</c>
