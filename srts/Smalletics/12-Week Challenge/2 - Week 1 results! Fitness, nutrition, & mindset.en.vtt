00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:31.940 align:start position:0%
percentage it went down point four so
 

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
percentage it went down point four so
that's<00:09:32.060><c> really</c><00:09:32.329><c> cool</c><00:09:32.570><c> went</c><00:09:32.899><c> from</c><00:09:33.079><c> seventeen</c>

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:33.529 align:start position:0%
that's really cool went from seventeen
 

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:35.139 align:start position:0%
that's really cool went from seventeen
point<00:09:33.740><c> eight</c><00:09:33.860><c> to</c><00:09:34.010><c> seventeen</c><00:09:34.399><c> point</c><00:09:34.670><c> four</c><00:09:34.910><c> and</c>

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:35.149 align:start position:0%
point eight to seventeen point four and
 

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:36.939 align:start position:0%
point eight to seventeen point four and
then<00:09:35.510><c> in</c><00:09:35.690><c> terms</c><00:09:35.839><c> of</c><00:09:36.019><c> my</c><00:09:36.140><c> muscle</c><00:09:36.529><c> mass</c><00:09:36.649><c> I</c>

00:09:36.939 --> 00:09:36.949 align:start position:0%
then in terms of my muscle mass I
 

00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:38.290 align:start position:0%
then in terms of my muscle mass I
actually<00:09:37.160><c> increased</c><00:09:37.670><c> my</c><00:09:37.820><c> muscle</c><00:09:38.209><c> mass</c>

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:38.300 align:start position:0%
actually increased my muscle mass
 

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.689 align:start position:0%
actually increased my muscle mass
despite<00:09:38.810><c> being</c><00:09:39.290><c> in</c><00:09:39.500><c> a</c><00:09:39.589><c> deficit</c><00:09:40.010><c> on</c><00:09:40.190><c> accident</c>

00:09:40.689 --> 00:09:40.699 align:start position:0%
despite being in a deficit on accident
 

00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:42.610 align:start position:0%
despite being in a deficit on accident
so<00:09:40.970><c> I</c><00:09:41.000><c> went</c><00:09:41.269><c> from</c><00:09:41.449><c> forty</c><00:09:41.930><c> seven</c><00:09:42.260><c> point</c><00:09:42.500><c> nine</c>

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:42.620 align:start position:0%
so I went from forty seven point nine
 

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
so I went from forty seven point nine
percent<00:09:43.250><c> to</c><00:09:43.459><c> forty</c><00:09:44.329><c> eight</c><00:09:44.360><c> point</c><00:09:44.779><c> one</c><00:09:44.930><c> so</c><00:09:45.410><c> is</c><00:09:45.500><c> a</c>

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:45.529 align:start position:0%
percent to forty eight point one so is a
 

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:47.829 align:start position:0%
percent to forty eight point one so is a
point<00:09:45.860><c> to</c><00:09:45.920><c> increase</c><00:09:46.790><c> modest</c><00:09:47.269><c> increase</c><00:09:47.600><c> but</c>

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
point to increase modest increase but
 

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:49.660 align:start position:0%
point to increase modest increase but
it's<00:09:47.990><c> great</c><00:09:48.260><c> to</c><00:09:48.410><c> see</c><00:09:48.589><c> that</c><00:09:48.829><c> I</c><00:09:49.130><c> was</c><00:09:49.310><c> still</c><00:09:49.519><c> able</c>

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:49.670 align:start position:0%
it's great to see that I was still able
 

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.310 align:start position:0%
it's great to see that I was still able

00:09:55.689 --> 00:09:55.699 align:start position:0%
as far as next steps basically Lizzie
 

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
as far as next steps basically Lizzie
and<00:09:55.790><c> I</c><00:09:55.850><c> decided</c><00:09:56.180><c> we</c><00:09:56.390><c> had</c><00:09:56.480><c> to</c><00:09:56.510><c> check</c><00:09:56.690><c> in</c><00:09:56.839><c> this</c>

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:56.930 align:start position:0%
