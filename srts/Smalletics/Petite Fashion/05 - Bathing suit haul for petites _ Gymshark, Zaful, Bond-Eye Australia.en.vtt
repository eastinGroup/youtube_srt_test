top inside and everywhere so it's a
little<00:05:46.130><c> small</c><00:05:46.940><c> but</c><00:05:47.270><c> if</c><00:05:47.660><c> you're</c><00:05:47.780><c> on</c><00:05:47.870><c> the</c>

little small but if you're on the
smaller<00:05:48.200><c> side</c><00:05:48.500><c> then</c><00:05:49.340><c> it's</c><00:05:49.520><c> pretty</c><00:05:49.760><c> fine</c><00:05:50.630><c> and</c>

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
smaller side then it's pretty fine and
 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.779 align:start position:0%
smaller side then it's pretty fine and
then<00:05:51.410><c> the</c><00:05:51.500><c> same</c><00:05:51.710><c> thing</c><00:05:51.890><c> goes</c><00:05:52.039><c> for</c><00:05:52.070><c> this</c><00:05:52.310><c> bottom</c>

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 align:start position:0%
then the same thing goes for this bottom
 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
then the same thing goes for this bottom
this<00:05:53.120><c> has</c><00:05:53.360><c> the</c><00:05:53.510><c> I</c><00:05:53.750><c> couldn't</c><00:05:53.960><c> even</c><00:05:54.110><c> tell</c><00:05:54.350><c> which</c>

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 align:start position:0%
this has the I couldn't even tell which
 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.830 align:start position:0%
this has the I couldn't even tell which
was<00:05:54.740><c> the</c><00:05:54.860><c> front</c><00:05:55.190><c> crotch</c><00:05:55.940><c> and</c><00:05:56.330><c> which</c><00:05:56.510><c> was</c><00:05:56.690><c> the</c>

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
was the front crotch and which was the
 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.650 align:start position:0%
was the front crotch and which was the
booty<00:05:57.140><c> because</c>

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
booty because
 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.700 align:start position:0%
booty because
so<00:05:58.430><c> it's</c><00:05:59.430><c> the</c><00:05:59.760><c> same</c><00:06:00.060><c> on</c><00:06:00.450><c> each</c><00:06:00.660><c> side</c><00:06:00.990><c> like</c>

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 align:start position:0%
so it's the same on each side like
 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.460 align:start position:0%
so it's the same on each side like
crotch<00:06:02.550><c> but</c><00:06:03.170><c> same</c><00:06:04.170><c> cut</c><00:06:04.740><c> I</c><00:06:05.960><c> just</c><00:06:06.960><c> made</c><00:06:07.170><c> a</c><00:06:07.200><c> song</c>

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 align:start position:0%
crotch but same cut I just made a song
 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.700 align:start position:0%
crotch but same cut I just made a song

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 align:start position:0%
so basically you could wear it either
 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.390 align:start position:0%
so basically you could wear it either
way<00:06:10.890><c> it's</c><00:06:11.280><c> like</c><00:06:11.430><c> a</c><00:06:11.460><c> reversible</c><00:06:12.060><c> crotch</c><00:06:12.480><c> but</c>

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
