00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.749 align:start position:0%
lean muscle mass let's talk about what
this<00:02:05.040><c> means</c>

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 align:start position:0%
this means
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.309 align:start position:0%
this means
so<00:02:06.159><c> yes</c><00:02:06.399><c> the</c><00:02:06.479><c> scale</c><00:02:06.799><c> went</c><00:02:07.040><c> down</c><00:02:07.439><c> but</c><00:02:07.759><c> it</c><00:02:07.840><c> was</c>

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
so yes the scale went down but it was
 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.949 align:start position:0%
so yes the scale went down but it was

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 align:start position:0%

muscle they lost not fat and that is
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.270 align:start position:0%
muscle they lost not fat and that is

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
very significant because what happens
 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.110 align:start position:0%
very significant because what happens
when<00:02:13.440><c> you</c><00:02:13.680><c> lose</c><00:02:14.080><c> muscle</c>

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
when you lose muscle
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.510 align:start position:0%
when you lose muscle
is<00:02:15.280><c> that</c><00:02:15.440><c> your</c><00:02:15.680><c> metabolism</c><00:02:16.640><c> decreases</c><00:02:17.360><c> and</c>

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
is that your metabolism decreases and
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.790 align:start position:0%
is that your metabolism decreases and
that's<00:02:17.760><c> because</c>

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's because
 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.710 align:start position:0%
that's because
it<00:02:19.040><c> is</c><00:02:19.360><c> very</c><00:02:20.800><c> energy</c><00:02:21.360><c> spendy</c><00:02:21.920><c> to</c><00:02:22.080><c> have</c><00:02:22.319><c> muscles</c>

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
it is very energy spendy to have muscles
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.910 align:start position:0%
it is very energy spendy to have muscles
so<00:02:22.879><c> of</c><00:02:23.040><c> course</c><00:02:23.280><c> if</c><00:02:23.440><c> you're</c><00:02:23.520><c> gonna</c><00:02:23.680><c> be</c><00:02:23.760><c> in</c><00:02:23.840><c> a</c>

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.790 align:start position:0%

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
they lost so much muscle mass
 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.550 align:start position:0%
they lost so much muscle mass

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like a lot right but

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.949 align:start position:0%
the problem is
they<00:02:58.959><c> lost</c><00:02:59.280><c> that</c><00:02:59.440><c> muscle</c><00:02:59.840><c> when</c><00:03:00.000><c> they</c><00:03:00.159><c> dieted</c>

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
and they lost that capacity
 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.589 align:start position:0%

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
to be able to burn up fat this is also
 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.550 align:start position:0%
to be able to burn up fat this is also
what's<00:03:05.760><c> known</c><00:03:06.080><c> as</c>

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
what's known as
 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.190 align:start position:0%
what's known as

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
metabolic adaptation a slower metabolism
 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
metabolic adaptation a slower metabolism
means<00:03:09.519><c> you</c><00:03:09.760><c> burn</c><00:03:10.080><c> fewer</c><00:03:10.400><c> calories</c><00:03:10.800><c> at</c><00:03:10.879><c> rest</c>

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
means you burn fewer calories at rest
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.110 align:start position:0%
means you burn fewer calories at rest
which<00:03:11.440><c> means</c><00:03:11.760><c> you're</c><00:03:12.000><c> more</c><00:03:12.159><c> efficient</c>

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
which means you're more efficient
 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.030 align:start position:0%
which means you're more efficient
and<00:03:13.280><c> that</c><00:03:13.440><c> also</c><00:03:13.760><c> means</c><00:03:14.080><c> that</c><00:03:14.319><c> you</c><00:03:14.560><c> don't</c><00:03:14.800><c> need</c>

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
and that also means that you don't need
 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.509 align:start position:0%
and that also means that you don't need
as<00:03:15.200><c> many</c><00:03:15.440><c> calories</c><00:03:15.840><c> anymore</c><00:03:16.400><c> to</c><00:03:16.640><c> exist</c>

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
as many calories anymore to exist
 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.229 align:start position:0%
as many calories anymore to exist
and<00:03:17.680><c> so</c><00:03:18.640><c> you</c><00:03:18.800><c> plateau</c><00:03:19.599><c> right</c><00:03:19.920><c> you're</c><00:03:20.080><c> not</c>

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
and so you plateau right you're not
 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.509 align:start position:0%
and so you plateau right you're not
going<00:03:20.400><c> to</c><00:03:20.480><c> lose</c><00:03:20.720><c> any</c><00:03:20.879><c> more</c><00:03:21.040><c> weight</c><00:03:21.280><c> because</c>

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
you're eating food and then exercising

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
when in reality it would require you to
 

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:10.949 align:start position:0%
when in reality it would require you to

that
 

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.990 align:start position:0%
that
so<00:16:12.240><c> you</c><00:16:12.320><c> can</c><00:16:12.480><c> see</c><00:16:12.639><c> how</c><00:16:12.800><c> this</c><00:16:13.040><c> logic</c><00:16:13.519><c> absolutely</c>

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
so you can see how this logic absolutely
 

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.790 align:start position:0%
so you can see how this logic absolutely
leads<00:16:14.320><c> to</c>

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
leads to
 

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.189 align:start position:0%
leads to

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
and so that's also why i don't recommend
 

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:20.870 align:start position:0%
and so that's also why i don't recommend
that<00:16:19.120><c> you</c><00:16:19.279><c> enter</c><00:16:19.519><c> a</c><00:16:19.600><c> calorie</c><00:16:19.920><c> deficit</c><00:16:20.399><c> by</c>
