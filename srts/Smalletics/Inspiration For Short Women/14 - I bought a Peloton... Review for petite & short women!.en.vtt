00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
that it was something i could stick to

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
was a lower impact but still
 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.990 align:start position:0%
was a lower impact but still
i<00:04:22.160><c> could</c><00:04:22.560><c> get</c><00:04:22.800><c> my</c><00:04:22.960><c> cardio</c><00:04:23.360><c> in</c><00:04:23.520><c> in</c><00:04:23.600><c> a</c><00:04:23.680><c> shorter</c>

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
and it came in october so there was
 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.270 align:start position:0%
and it came in october so there was
quite<00:04:44.240><c> a</c><00:04:44.400><c> bit</c><00:04:44.560><c> of</c><00:04:44.720><c> a</c><00:04:44.800><c> delay</c>

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of a delay
 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.110 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of a delay
that's<00:04:45.440><c> the</c><00:04:45.600><c> first</c><00:04:45.759><c> thing</c><00:04:45.919><c> i</c><00:04:46.000><c> will</c><00:04:46.240><c> say</c><00:04:46.880><c> it</c>

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing i will say it
 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing i will say it
might<00:04:47.280><c> take</c><00:04:47.440><c> some</c><00:04:47.600><c> time</c><00:04:47.840><c> to</c><00:04:47.919><c> get</c><00:04:48.160><c> your</c><00:04:48.479><c> bike</c><00:04:48.800><c> so</c>

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
might take some time to get your bike so
 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.230 align:start position:0%
might take some time to get your bike so
just<00:04:49.120><c> watch</c><00:04:49.360><c> out</c><00:04:49.440><c> for</c><00:04:49.600><c> that</c>

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
just watch out for that
 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.670 align:start position:0%
just watch out for that
so<00:04:50.479><c> i</c><00:04:50.560><c> will</c><00:04:50.720><c> start</c><00:04:50.960><c> off</c><00:04:51.040><c> by</c><00:04:51.199><c> saying</c><00:04:51.440><c> that</c><00:04:51.600><c> it</c>

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
so i will start off by saying that it
 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.070 align:start position:0%
so i will start off by saying that it
has<00:04:52.000><c> really</c><00:04:52.240><c> become</c><00:04:52.639><c> my</c><00:04:53.120><c> step</c><00:04:53.440><c> count</c>

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
has really become my step count
 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.189 align:start position:0%
has really become my step count

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
so that i'm not so sedentary and i think
 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
so that i'm not so sedentary and i think
that<00:06:34.400><c> a</c><00:06:34.479><c> lot</c><00:06:34.639><c> of</c><00:06:34.800><c> us</c><00:06:34.960><c> are</c><00:06:35.039><c> in</c><00:06:35.199><c> that</c><00:06:35.280><c> same</c>

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%

so<00:06:37.199><c> those</c><00:06:37.440><c> would</c><00:06:37.600><c> be</c><00:06:37.759><c> all</c><00:06:37.919><c> the</c><00:06:38.080><c> reasons</c><00:06:38.400><c> why</c><00:06:38.479><c> i</c>

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
so those would be all the reasons why i
 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.070 align:start position:0%
so those would be all the reasons why i
got<00:06:38.720><c> it</c><00:06:38.800><c> and</c><00:06:38.960><c> a</c><00:06:39.039><c> lot</c><00:06:39.120><c> of</c><00:06:39.280><c> the</c><00:06:39.360><c> pros</c><00:06:39.759><c> are</c><00:06:39.840><c> wrapped</c>

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
the app is 39 something per month so
 

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:05.030 align:start position:0%
the app is 39 something per month so
it's<00:11:04.079><c> expensive</c>

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's expensive
 

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.030 align:start position:0%
it's expensive
and<00:11:05.360><c> the</c><00:11:05.519><c> app</c><00:11:05.760><c> is</c><00:11:05.920><c> amazing</c><00:11:06.399><c> i</c><00:11:06.480><c> mean</c><00:11:06.640><c> it</c><00:11:06.720><c> has</c>

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the app is amazing i mean it has
 

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.350 align:start position:0%
and the app is amazing i mean it has
literally<00:11:07.760><c> so</c><00:11:07.920><c> many</c><00:11:08.160><c> on-demand</c><00:11:08.720><c> workouts</c>

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
literally so many on-demand workouts

so many different trainers so many
 

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.310 align:start position:0%
so many different trainers so many

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
different things to choose from whether
 

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.230 align:start position:0%
different things to choose from whether
it's<00:11:12.560><c> the</c><00:11:12.720><c> bike</c><00:11:12.959><c> or</c><00:11:13.200><c> another</c><00:11:13.440><c> type</c><00:11:13.680><c> of</c><00:11:13.839><c> workout</c>

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's the bike or another type of workout
 

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:14.710 align:start position:0%
it's the bike or another type of workout
like

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
like
they<00:11:14.880><c> have</c><00:11:15.360><c> floor</c><00:11:15.760><c> workouts</c><00:11:16.399><c> and</c><00:11:17.200><c> cardio</c><00:11:17.680><c> and</c>

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
they have floor workouts and cardio and
 

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.790 align:start position:0%
they have floor workouts and cardio and
whatever

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
whatever
 

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.910 align:start position:0%
whatever
but<00:11:19.279><c> i</c><00:11:19.440><c> think</c><00:11:20.160><c> the</c><00:11:20.399><c> bike</c><00:11:20.640><c> without</c><00:11:21.040><c> the</c><00:11:21.200><c> app</c>

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
but i think the bike without the app
 

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.230 align:start position:0%
but i think the bike without the app
would<00:11:22.079><c> be</c><00:11:22.560><c> pretty</c><00:11:23.360><c> limited</c><00:11:23.839><c> i</c><00:11:23.920><c> don't</c><00:11:24.079><c> think</c>

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
would be pretty limited i don't think
 

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.430 align:start position:0%
would be pretty limited i don't think
there's<00:11:24.480><c> that</c><00:11:24.640><c> much</c><00:11:24.800><c> you</c><00:11:24.959><c> can</c><00:11:25.040><c> do</c><00:11:25.200><c> with</c><00:11:25.279><c> it</c>

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's that much you can do with it
 

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.190 align:start position:0%
there's that much you can do with it
except<00:11:25.680><c> for</c><00:11:25.839><c> like</c><00:11:26.000><c> free</c><00:11:26.240><c> ride</c><00:11:26.640><c> like</c><00:11:26.800><c> you</c><00:11:26.959><c> can't</c>

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.150 align:start position:0%
