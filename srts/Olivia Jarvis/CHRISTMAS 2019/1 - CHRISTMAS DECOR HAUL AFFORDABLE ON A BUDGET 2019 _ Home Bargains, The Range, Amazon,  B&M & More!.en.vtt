yeah they should do the whole tree and
 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah they should do the whole tree and
also<00:04:28.080><c> you</c><00:04:28.350><c> can</c><00:04:28.590><c> just</c><00:04:28.830><c> make</c><00:04:29.250><c> like</c><00:04:29.550><c> you</c><00:04:29.699><c> know</c><00:04:29.789><c> if</c>

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 align:start position:0%
also you can just make like you know if
 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.939 align:start position:0%
also you can just make like you know if

tight<00:04:32.190><c> stuff</c><00:04:32.639><c> you</c><00:04:32.910><c> can</c><00:04:33.060><c> just</c><00:04:33.240><c> spray</c><00:04:33.479><c> down</c><00:04:33.510><c> as</c>

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
tight stuff you can just spray down as
 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.210 align:start position:0%
tight stuff you can just spray down as
well<00:04:34.020><c> and</c><00:04:34.229><c> I</c><00:04:34.320><c> just</c><00:04:34.350><c> think</c><00:04:34.590><c> it</c><00:04:34.710><c> looks</c><00:04:34.860><c> so</c><00:04:35.070><c> much</c>

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
well and I just think it looks so much
 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.270 align:start position:0%
well and I just think it looks so much
nicer<00:04:35.460><c> like</c><00:04:36.360><c> spray</c><00:04:36.720><c> like</c><00:04:36.990><c> a</c><00:04:37.020><c> snowy</c><00:04:37.410><c> color</c><00:04:37.830><c> and</c>

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
nicer like spray like a snowy color and
 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
nicer like spray like a snowy color and
it's<00:04:39.090><c> a</c><00:04:39.120><c> bit</c><00:04:39.240><c> more</c><00:04:39.270><c> modern</c><00:04:39.720><c> I</c><00:04:39.870><c> think</c><00:04:40.169><c> as</c><00:04:40.350><c> well</c>

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 align:start position:0%
it's a bit more modern I think as well
 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's a bit more modern I think as well
that's<00:04:41.280><c> just</c><00:04:41.460><c> my</c><00:04:41.669><c> opinion</c><00:04:42.120><c> probably</c><00:04:42.539><c> will</c><00:04:42.810><c> go</c>

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 align:start position:0%
that's just my opinion probably will go
 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.629 align:start position:0%
that's just my opinion probably will go
