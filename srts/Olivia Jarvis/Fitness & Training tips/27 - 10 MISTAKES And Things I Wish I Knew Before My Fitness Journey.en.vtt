any weight loss or muscle gain so yeah

is weight loss you'll probably notice

is weight loss you'll probably notice

quite a lot within the first few weeks
 

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.030 align:start position:0%
quite a lot within the first few weeks

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
and then it might sort of slow down

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
so that's where your body is adapting
 

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.550 align:start position:0%
so that's where your body is adapting
and<00:10:45.360><c> it'll</c><00:10:45.519><c> be</c><00:10:45.600><c> a</c><00:10:45.680><c> bit</c><00:10:45.920><c> harder</c>

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
and it'll be a bit harder
 

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.269 align:start position:0%
and it'll be a bit harder

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
the first few weeks and then from that
