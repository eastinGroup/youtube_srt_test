matching set which I think may be in a
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.759 align:start position:0%
matching set which I think may be in a
different<00:03:08.459><c> color</c><00:03:08.790><c> I</c><00:03:09.060><c> might</c><00:03:09.239><c> prefer</c><00:03:09.420><c> but</c><00:03:09.959><c> Tim</c>

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 align:start position:0%
different color I might prefer but Tim
 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
different color I might prefer but Tim
it<00:03:10.890><c> for</c><00:03:11.069><c> me</c><00:03:11.220><c> it's</c><00:03:12.030><c> too</c><00:03:12.300><c> close</c><00:03:12.630><c> to</c><00:03:13.319><c> like</c><00:03:13.860><c> I</c><00:03:14.330><c> look</c>

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 align:start position:0%
it for me it's too close to like I look
 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.300 align:start position:0%
it for me it's too close to like I look
like<00:03:15.450><c> I'm</c><00:03:15.600><c> kind</c><00:03:15.810><c> of</c><00:03:15.900><c> worried</c><00:03:16.080><c> like</c><00:03:16.290><c> her</c><00:03:16.530><c> I</c><00:03:16.769><c> won</c>

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 align:start position:0%
like I'm kind of worried like her I won
 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
like I'm kind of worried like her I won
a<00:03:17.579><c> onesie</c><00:03:18.450><c> in</c><00:03:18.630><c> which</c><00:03:18.780><c> isn't</c><00:03:19.140><c> my</c><00:03:19.290><c> favorite</c><00:03:19.769><c> so</c><00:03:20.220><c> I</c>

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 align:start position:0%
a onesie in which isn't my favorite so I
 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.190 align:start position:0%
a onesie in which isn't my favorite so I
think<00:03:20.370><c> had</c><00:03:20.640><c> were</c><00:03:20.820><c> these</c><00:03:21.000><c> separately</c><00:03:21.600><c> but</c><00:03:22.049><c> I</c>

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
think had were these separately but I
 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.330 align:start position:0%
think had were these separately but I
don't<00:03:22.530><c> think</c><00:03:22.590><c> I</c><00:03:22.739><c> would</c><00:03:22.890><c> wear</c><00:03:23.040><c> them</c><00:03:23.160><c> together</c>

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
don't think I would wear them together
 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
don't think I would wear them together
or<00:03:23.730><c> maybe</c><00:03:23.910><c> I'd</c><00:03:24.420><c> like</c><00:03:24.989><c> it</c><00:03:25.140><c> in</c><00:03:25.230><c> a</c><00:03:25.290><c> different</c>

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 align:start position:0%
or maybe I'd like it in a different
 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.780 align:start position:0%
or maybe I'd like it in a different
color<00:03:25.829><c> but</c><00:03:26.040><c> it's</c><00:03:26.160><c> something</c><00:03:26.310><c> I</c><00:03:26.430><c> really</c><00:03:26.640><c> like</c>
