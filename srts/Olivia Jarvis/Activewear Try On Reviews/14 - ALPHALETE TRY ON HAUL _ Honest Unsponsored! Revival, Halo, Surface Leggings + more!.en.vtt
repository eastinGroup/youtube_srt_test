was the only thing like I'd say but it's
 

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.050 align:start position:0%
was the only thing like I'd say but it's
just<00:08:31.740><c> like</c><00:08:31.920><c> personal</c><00:08:32.280><c> preference</c><00:08:32.670><c> isn't</c><00:08:32.940><c> it</c><00:08:33.000><c> I</c>

we'll<00:09:10.150><c> just</c><00:09:10.180><c> have</c><00:09:10.330><c> to</c><00:09:10.510><c> see</c><00:09:10.690><c> I'm</c><00:09:10.990><c> not</c><00:09:11.080><c> going</c><00:09:11.260><c> to</c>

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
we'll just have to see I'm not going to
 

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.590 align:start position:0%
we'll just have to see I'm not going to
judge<00:09:11.500><c> until</c><00:09:11.680><c> I've</c><00:09:11.890><c> tried</c><00:09:12.130><c> them</c><00:09:12.250><c> on</c><00:09:12.370><c> and</c><00:09:12.670><c> I</c>

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
judge until I've tried them on and I
 

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
judge until I've tried them on and I
think<00:09:14.380><c> these</c><00:09:14.560><c> look</c><00:09:14.770><c> more</c><00:09:14.800><c> of</c><00:09:15.190><c> like</c><00:09:15.520><c> a</c>

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:15.550 align:start position:0%
think these look more of like a
 

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.090 align:start position:0%
think these look more of like a
compressive<00:09:16.540><c> bit</c><00:09:16.840><c> but</c><00:09:17.350><c> they've</c><00:09:17.470><c> got</c><00:09:17.620><c> so</c><00:09:17.920><c> much</c>

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.100 align:start position:0%
compressive bit but they've got so much
 

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
compressive bit but they've got so much
detail<00:09:18.370><c> in</c><00:09:18.870><c> around</c><00:09:19.870><c> the</c><00:09:20.140><c> legs</c><00:09:20.380><c> here</c><00:09:20.980><c> that</c><00:09:21.220><c> I've</c>

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.310 align:start position:0%
detail in around the legs here that I've
 

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.030 align:start position:0%
detail in around the legs here that I've
noticed<00:09:21.490><c> straight</c><00:09:21.940><c> way</c><00:09:22.120><c> thicker</c><00:09:22.720><c> fabric</c><00:09:23.350><c> and</c>

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
noticed straight way thicker fabric and
 

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.250 align:start position:0%
noticed straight way thicker fabric and
then<00:09:24.160><c> they've</c><00:09:24.310><c> got</c><00:09:24.430><c> that</c><00:09:24.520><c> artfully</c><00:09:25.120><c> on</c><00:09:25.600><c> the</c>

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:26.260 align:start position:0%
then they've got that artfully on the
 

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.590 align:start position:0%
then they've got that artfully on the
back<00:09:26.470><c> straight</c><00:09:27.010><c> off</c><00:09:27.190><c> I</c><00:09:27.580><c> really</c><00:09:28.150><c> like</c><00:09:28.300><c> how</c>

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
back straight off I really like how
 

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.350 align:start position:0%
back straight off I really like how
that's<00:09:29.080><c> like</c><00:09:29.290><c> stitched</c><00:09:29.770><c> logo</c><00:09:30.610><c> rather</c><00:09:31.000><c> than</c>

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's like stitched logo rather than
 

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.810 align:start position:0%
that's like stitched logo rather than
and<00:09:31.710><c> you</c><00:09:32.710><c> know</c><00:09:32.800><c> and</c><00:09:32.950><c> it's</c><00:09:33.040><c> like</c><00:09:33.100><c> that</c><00:09:33.370><c> plastic</c>

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:33.820 align:start position:0%
and you know and it's like that plastic
 

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
and you know and it's like that plastic
you<00:09:33.940><c> like</c><00:09:34.150><c> put</c><00:09:34.450><c> on</c><00:09:34.630><c> because</c><00:09:34.870><c> didn't</c><00:09:35.560><c> you</c><00:09:35.620><c> know</c>

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:35.710 align:start position:0%
you like put on because didn't you know
 

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
you like put on because didn't you know
and<00:09:35.830><c> it</c><00:09:35.920><c> comes</c><00:09:36.070><c> off</c><00:09:36.190><c> in</c><00:09:36.310><c> the</c><00:09:36.400><c> wash</c><00:09:36.550><c> it's</c><00:09:36.790><c> so</c>

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:36.970 align:start position:0%
and it comes off in the wash it's so
 

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
and it comes off in the wash it's so
nine<00:09:37.180><c> and</c><00:09:37.390><c> then</c><00:09:37.480><c> it</c><00:09:37.570><c> just</c><00:09:37.720><c> looked</c><00:09:37.930><c> awfully</c>

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:38.350 align:start position:0%
nine and then it just looked awfully
 

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.950 align:start position:0%
nine and then it just looked awfully
like<00:09:38.560><c> it</c><00:09:39.250><c> starts</c><00:09:39.580><c> cracking</c><00:09:40.120><c> and</c><00:09:40.450><c> just</c><00:09:40.750><c> doesn't</c>

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
like it starts cracking and just doesn't
 

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
like it starts cracking and just doesn't
look<00:09:41.020><c> great</c><00:09:41.170><c> so</c><00:09:41.560><c> obviously</c><00:09:42.250><c> you're</c><00:09:42.430><c> not</c><00:09:42.490><c> gonna</c>

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:42.670 align:start position:0%

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.290 align:start position:0%
I've got darken well but I do think
 

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
I've got darken well but I do think
these<00:10:02.530><c> seem</c><00:10:02.980><c> to</c><00:10:03.010><c> be</c><00:10:03.160><c> like</c><00:10:03.310><c> more</c><00:10:03.720><c> Shearer</c><00:10:04.720><c> and</c>

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.110 align:start position:0%
these seem to be like more Shearer and

these seem to be like more Shearer and
and<00:10:05.980><c> this</c><00:10:06.130><c> is</c><00:10:06.250><c> the</c><00:10:06.370><c> same</c><00:10:06.550><c> motor</c><00:10:06.760><c> small</c><00:10:07.000><c> but</c><00:10:07.570><c> I</c>

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:07.660 align:start position:0%
and this is the same motor small but I
 

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.130 align:start position:0%
and this is the same motor small but I
find<00:10:07.990><c> that</c><00:10:08.790><c> these</c><00:10:09.790><c> fit</c><00:10:10.150><c> the</c><00:10:10.330><c> better</c><00:10:10.540><c> than</c><00:10:11.020><c> the</c>

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.140 align:start position:0%
find that these fit the better than the
