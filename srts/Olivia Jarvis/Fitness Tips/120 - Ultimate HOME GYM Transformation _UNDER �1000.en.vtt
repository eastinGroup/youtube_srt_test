kitchen
 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
kitchen
it's<00:06:49.199><c> pretty</c><00:06:49.440><c> decent</c><00:06:49.840><c> we</c><00:06:50.000><c> ended</c><00:06:50.160><c> up</c><00:06:50.400><c> going</c>

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's pretty decent we ended up going
 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.350 align:start position:0%
it's pretty decent we ended up going

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
with the half rack which just makes more
 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.830 align:start position:0%
with the half rack which just makes more
sense

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
sense
 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.150 align:start position:0%
sense
like<00:06:54.240><c> i</c><00:06:54.400><c> managed</c><00:06:54.800><c> to</c><00:06:55.199><c> address</c><00:06:55.520><c> this</c><00:06:55.680><c> obviously</c>

like i managed to address this obviously
 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
like i managed to address this obviously
and<00:06:56.240><c> then</c><00:06:56.720><c> we</c><00:06:56.880><c> might</c><00:06:57.120><c> get</c><00:06:57.360><c> some</c>

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
and then we might get some
 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.629 align:start position:0%
and then we might get some
