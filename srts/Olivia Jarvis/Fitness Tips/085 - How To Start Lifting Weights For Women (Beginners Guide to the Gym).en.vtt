00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 align:start position:0%

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
of resistance training this can be done
 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.830 align:start position:0%
of resistance training this can be done
literally<00:01:19.520><c> through</c><00:01:20.320><c> like</c><00:01:20.640><c> bands</c><00:01:21.280><c> uh</c><00:01:21.520><c> body</c>

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
obviously is like the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
kind of like superior stimuli because
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.830 align:start position:0%
kind of like superior stimuli because
you<00:01:28.080><c> can</c><00:01:28.479><c> increase</c><00:01:28.799><c> your</c><00:01:28.960><c> weight</c><00:01:29.280><c> and</c>

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
you can increase your weight and
 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.590 align:start position:0%
you can increase your weight and
progressively<00:01:30.640><c> overload</c><00:01:31.040><c> like</c><00:01:31.280><c> over</c><00:01:31.520><c> a</c>

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
progressively overload like over a
 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.190 align:start position:0%
progressively overload like over a

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
period of time ultimately like
 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.230 align:start position:0%
period of time ultimately like
resistance<00:01:33.759><c> training</c>

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
resistance training
 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.710 align:start position:0%
resistance training
just<00:01:34.880><c> tears</c><00:01:35.280><c> down</c><00:01:35.600><c> your</c><00:01:35.840><c> muscles</c><00:01:36.320><c> so</c><00:01:36.479><c> that</c><00:01:36.640><c> it</c>

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
just tears down your muscles so that it
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.030 align:start position:0%
just tears down your muscles so that it
can<00:01:36.960><c> rebuild</c><00:01:37.360><c> itself</c><00:01:37.840><c> stronger</c><00:01:38.400><c> than</c><00:01:38.640><c> it</c><00:01:38.720><c> was</c>

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
can rebuild itself stronger than it was
 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.590 align:start position:0%
can rebuild itself stronger than it was
before<00:01:39.600><c> so</c><00:01:39.759><c> that's</c><00:01:40.000><c> how</c><00:01:40.159><c> it</c><00:01:40.320><c> works</c><00:01:41.119><c> for</c><00:01:41.280><c> this</c>

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
before so that's how it works for this
 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.069 align:start position:0%
