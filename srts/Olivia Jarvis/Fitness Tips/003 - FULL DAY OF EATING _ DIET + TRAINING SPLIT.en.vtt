00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:03.870 align:start position:0%
down and do more high volume stuff but
 

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.150 align:start position:0%
down and do more high volume stuff but

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
the moment I'm in quite a happy like
 

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
the moment I'm in quite a happy like
maintenance<00:11:05.490><c> Bay</c><00:11:05.850><c> and</c><00:11:06.120><c> then</c><00:11:06.210><c> I</c><00:11:06.240><c> guess</c><00:11:06.540><c> I</c><00:11:06.750><c> got</c>
