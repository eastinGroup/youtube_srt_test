these<00:00:15.240><c> four</c><00:00:15.299><c> bright</c><00:00:15.960><c> ones</c><00:00:16.230><c> and</c><00:00:16.680><c> then</c><00:00:16.890><c> maybe</c>

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 align:start position:0%
these four bright ones and then maybe
 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.970 align:start position:0%
these four bright ones and then maybe
these<00:00:17.490><c> three</c><00:00:17.820><c> down</c><00:00:18.150><c> here</c><00:00:18.539><c> it</c><00:00:19.260><c> was</c><00:00:19.380><c> included</c><00:00:19.650><c> by</c>

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
these three down here it was included by
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.220 align:start position:0%
these three down here it was included by
Messier<00:00:20.369><c> in</c><00:00:21.029><c> his</c><00:00:21.270><c> catalog</c><00:00:21.720><c> obviously</c><00:00:22.080><c> because</c>

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 align:start position:0%
Messier in his catalog obviously because
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.779 align:start position:0%
Messier in his catalog obviously because
we're<00:00:22.380><c> talking</c><00:00:22.500><c> about</c><00:00:22.800><c> it</c><00:00:22.890><c> today</c><00:00:23.010><c> but</c><00:00:23.670><c> yeah</c>

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it today but yeah
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.250 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it today but yeah
even<00:00:24.119><c> though</c><00:00:24.210><c> it's</c><00:00:24.359><c> boring</c><00:00:24.869><c> I</c><00:00:24.990><c> think</c><00:00:25.019><c> the</c>

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
even though it's boring I think the
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.929 align:start position:0%
even though it's boring I think the
story<00:00:25.590><c> behind</c><00:00:25.800><c> it</c><00:00:26.220><c> is</c><00:00:26.310><c> an</c><00:00:26.430><c> important</c><00:00:26.820><c> one</c>

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 align:start position:0%
story behind it is an important one
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.310 align:start position:0%
story behind it is an important one
still<00:00:27.210><c> because</c><00:00:27.449><c> it's</c><00:00:27.599><c> a</c><00:00:27.720><c> story</c><00:00:27.960><c> of</c>

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
still because it's a story of
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.500 align:start position:0%
still because it's a story of
confirmation<00:00:29.160><c> bias</c><00:00:29.189><c> and</c><00:00:29.820><c> the</c><00:00:29.939><c> scientific</c>

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 align:start position:0%
confirmation bias and the scientific
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.389 align:start position:0%
confirmation bias and the scientific
process<00:00:30.810><c> so</c><00:00:31.320><c> it's</c><00:00:31.470><c> still</c><00:00:31.679><c> really</c><00:00:31.710><c> important</c>

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
process so it's still really important
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.860 align:start position:0%
process so it's still really important
to<00:00:32.550><c> sort</c><00:00:32.759><c> of</c><00:00:32.790><c> understand</c><00:00:33.210><c> this</c><00:00:33.390><c> so</c><00:00:33.690><c> it</c><00:00:33.780><c> all</c>

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 align:start position:0%
to sort of understand this so it all
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.180 align:start position:0%
to sort of understand this so it all
started<00:00:34.170><c> with</c><00:00:34.230><c> Messier</c><00:00:34.530><c> when</c><00:00:34.800><c> he</c><00:00:35.040><c> was</c>

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 align:start position:0%
started with Messier when he was
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.479 align:start position:0%
started with Messier when he was

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.639 align:start position:0%
nebulosity which just means they were

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 align:start position:0%
sort of fuzzy in the sky and he said
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.819 align:start position:0%
sort of fuzzy in the sky and he said
that<00:00:43.950><c> that</c><00:00:44.399><c> object</c><00:00:44.820><c> was</c><00:00:45.629><c> fuzzy</c><00:00:45.870><c> he</c><00:00:46.530><c> thought</c><00:00:46.739><c> it</c>

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 align:start position:0%
that that object was fuzzy he thought it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 align:start position:0%

what's called a color magnitude diagram
 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.930 align:start position:0%
what's called a color magnitude diagram
so<00:03:01.860><c> people</c><00:03:02.100><c> might</c><00:03:02.220><c> be</c><00:03:02.310><c> familiar</c><00:03:02.340><c> with</c><00:03:02.700><c> the</c>

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
so people might be familiar with the
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
so people might be familiar with the
hertzsprung-russell<00:03:03.240><c> diagram</c><00:03:03.450><c> of</c><00:03:04.290><c> stars</c><00:03:04.590><c> so</c>

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 align:start position:0%
hertzsprung-russell diagram of stars so
 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.070 align:start position:0%
hertzsprung-russell diagram of stars so
as<00:03:05.370><c> you</c><00:03:05.520><c> get</c><00:03:05.700><c> brighter</c><00:03:06.150><c> and</c><00:03:06.300><c> brighter</c><00:03:06.450><c> you</c><00:03:06.870><c> get</c>

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
as you get brighter and brighter you get
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.290 align:start position:0%
as you get brighter and brighter you get
bluer<00:03:07.530><c> and</c><00:03:07.920><c> so</c><00:03:08.340><c> you</c><00:03:08.400><c> end</c><00:03:08.640><c> up</c><00:03:08.760><c> with</c><00:03:08.940><c> this</c><00:03:09.060><c> really</c>

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 align:start position:0%

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.960 align:start position:0%

that's got a lot of scatter around it
 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.229 align:start position:0%
that's got a lot of scatter around it

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
by looking at it I can maybe give these

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 align:start position:0%
happen but how did I also then get
 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.010 align:start position:0%
happen but how did I also then get
through<00:04:23.280><c> peer</c><00:04:23.550><c> review</c><00:04:23.690><c> yeah</c><00:04:24.690><c> well</c><00:04:24.930><c> they</c>

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
through peer review yeah well they
 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.070 align:start position:0%
through peer review yeah well they
always<00:04:25.229><c> see</c><00:04:25.380><c> both</c><00:04:25.650><c> papers</c><00:04:26.310><c> where</c><00:04:26.520><c> independent</c>

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
always see both papers where independent
 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.409 align:start position:0%
always see both papers where independent
peer-reviewed<00:04:27.680><c> so</c><00:04:28.610><c> if</c><00:04:28.789><c> you're</c><00:04:28.939><c> looking</c><00:04:29.300><c> at</c><00:04:29.389><c> a</c>

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed so if you're looking at a
 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.909 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed so if you're looking at a
plot<00:04:29.689><c> and</c><00:04:29.930><c> they're</c><00:04:30.110><c> saying</c><00:04:30.349><c> this</c><00:04:30.590><c> clearly</c>

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 align:start position:0%
plot and they're saying this clearly
 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.249 align:start position:0%
plot and they're saying this clearly
shows<00:04:31.129><c> this</c><00:04:31.389><c> the</c><00:04:32.389><c> referee</c><00:04:32.689><c> might</c><00:04:32.960><c> be</c><00:04:33.110><c> like</c>

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 align:start position:0%
shows this the referee might be like
 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
shows this the referee might be like
yeah<00:04:34.099><c> okay</c><00:04:34.340><c> I</c><00:04:34.370><c> can</c><00:04:34.550><c> see</c><00:04:34.699><c> that</c><00:04:34.990><c> so</c><00:04:35.990><c> you</c><00:04:36.020><c> can</c><00:04:36.349><c> see</c>

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I can see that so you can see
 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.589 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I can see that so you can see
how<00:04:36.740><c> the</c><00:04:36.800><c> bias</c><00:04:37.250><c> spreads</c><00:04:37.669><c> as</c><00:04:38.000><c> well</c><00:04:38.240><c> you</c><00:04:38.449><c> want</c><00:04:38.569><c> to</c>

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
how the bias spreads as well you want to
 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.709 align:start position:0%
how the bias spreads as well you want to
see<00:04:38.719><c> the</c><00:04:38.810><c> plots</c><00:04:39.020><c> side-by-side</c><00:04:39.969><c> so</c><00:04:40.969><c> the</c>

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:41.719 align:start position:0%
see the plots side-by-side so the
 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:43.029 align:start position:0%
see the plots side-by-side so the

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
numbered stars are the ones they think
 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.379 align:start position:0%
numbered stars are the ones they think

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 align:start position:0%
you're in the cluster and the cross is
 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.820 align:start position:0%
you're in the cluster and the cross is
the<00:04:44.419><c> ones</c><00:04:44.659><c> that</c><00:04:44.900><c> maybe</c><00:04:45.110><c> they</c><00:04:45.319><c> could</c><00:04:45.530><c> be</c><00:04:45.560><c> but</c>

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 align:start position:0%
the ones that maybe they could be but
 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.010 align:start position:0%
the ones that maybe they could be but
maybe<00:04:45.949><c> they're</c><00:04:46.219><c> not</c><00:04:46.340><c> and</c><00:04:46.669><c> they</c><00:04:47.150><c> say</c><00:04:47.419><c> this</c>

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 align:start position:0%
maybe they're not and they say this
 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.809 align:start position:0%
maybe they're not and they say this
clearly<00:04:48.349><c> follows</c><00:04:48.740><c> this</c><00:04:48.919><c> tight</c><00:04:49.189><c> relationship</c>

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 align:start position:0%
clearly follows this tight relationship
 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.879 align:start position:0%
clearly follows this tight relationship
and<00:04:50.389><c> then</c><00:04:50.479><c> this</c><00:04:50.629><c> one</c><00:04:50.780><c> here</c><00:04:51.050><c> plotting</c><00:04:51.439><c> the</c><00:04:51.680><c> same</c>

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 align:start position:0%
and then this one here plotting the same
 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.369 align:start position:0%
and then this one here plotting the same
thing<00:04:52.360><c> where</c><00:04:53.360><c> all</c><00:04:53.389><c> the</c><00:04:53.599><c> stars</c><00:04:53.840><c> I</c><00:04:53.990><c> think</c><00:04:54.199><c> are</c><00:04:54.289><c> in</c>

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379 align:start position:0%
thing where all the stars I think are in
 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.140 align:start position:0%
thing where all the stars I think are in
the<00:04:54.469><c> cluster</c><00:04:54.620><c> they</c><00:04:55.340><c> say</c><00:04:55.580><c> well</c><00:04:55.759><c> clearly</c><00:04:55.969><c> it's</c>

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 align:start position:0%
the cluster they say well clearly it's
 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.399 align:start position:0%
the cluster they say well clearly it's
just<00:04:56.330><c> scatter</c><00:04:56.569><c> and</c><00:04:56.780><c> there's</c><00:04:56.930><c> no</c><00:04:57.020><c> relationship</c>

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 align:start position:0%
just scatter and there's no relationship
 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.700 align:start position:0%
just scatter and there's no relationship
there<00:04:58.000><c> so</c><00:04:59.000><c> that's</c><00:04:59.180><c> the</c><00:04:59.330><c> exact</c><00:04:59.599><c> same</c><00:04:59.810><c> plot</c><00:05:00.500><c> as</c>

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 align:start position:0%
there so that's the exact same plot as
 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.670 align:start position:0%
there so that's the exact same plot as
the<00:05:00.830><c> other</c><00:05:00.919><c> one</c><00:05:01.039><c> before</c><00:05:01.340><c> the</c><00:05:01.849><c> Bema</c><00:05:02.780><c> against</c><00:05:03.349><c> B</c>

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
the other one before the Bema against B
 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.700 align:start position:0%
the other one before the Bema against B
-<00:05:03.979><c> V</c><00:05:04.009><c> V</c><00:05:04.789><c> against</c><00:05:05.030><c> B</c><00:05:05.210><c> -</c><00:05:05.449><c> V</c><00:05:05.479><c> so</c><00:05:06.050><c> another</c><00:05:06.530><c> paper</c>

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 align:start position:0%
- V V against B - V so another paper
 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.740 align:start position:0%
- V V against B - V so another paper
then<00:05:07.009><c> finally</c><00:05:07.310><c> came</c><00:05:07.430><c> out</c><00:05:07.580><c> in</c><00:05:07.699><c> 2002</c><00:05:08.300><c> where</c>

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 align:start position:0%
then finally came out in 2002 where
 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.089 align:start position:0%
then finally came out in 2002 where
they'd<00:05:08.870><c> actually</c><00:05:09.020><c> thought</c><00:05:09.229><c> to</c><00:05:09.349><c> get</c><00:05:09.560><c> spectra</c>

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 align:start position:0%
they'd actually thought to get spectra
 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.219 align:start position:0%
they'd actually thought to get spectra
of<00:05:10.280><c> these</c><00:05:10.699><c> things</c><00:05:10.969><c> and</c><00:05:11.270><c> with</c><00:05:11.419><c> the</c><00:05:11.509><c> spectra</c><00:05:11.960><c> you</c>

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 align:start position:0%
of these things and with the spectra you
 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.830 align:start position:0%
of these things and with the spectra you
can<00:05:12.409><c> get</c><00:05:12.650><c> the</c><00:05:13.099><c> velocity</c><00:05:13.370><c> shift</c><00:05:14.060><c> relative</c><00:05:14.569><c> to</c>

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
can get the velocity shift relative to
 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.170 align:start position:0%
can get the velocity shift relative to
it<00:05:15.080><c> so</c><00:05:15.409><c> the</c><00:05:15.860><c> at</c><00:05:16.009><c> this</c><00:05:16.159><c> idea</c><00:05:16.340><c> of</c><00:05:16.520><c> red</c><00:05:16.729><c> shift</c><00:05:16.909><c> blue</c>

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 align:start position:0%
it so the at this idea of red shift blue
 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.700 align:start position:0%
it so the at this idea of red shift blue
shift<00:05:17.419><c> whether</c><00:05:17.690><c> the</c><00:05:17.840><c> stars</c><00:05:18.229><c> are</c><00:05:18.409><c> moving</c><00:05:18.500><c> away</c>

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 align:start position:0%
shift whether the stars are moving away
