00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 align:start position:0%
just in general I had very small areolas
 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
just in general I had very small areolas
to<00:05:16.100><c> start</c><00:05:16.340><c> with</c><00:05:16.460><c> just</c><00:05:17.000><c> because</c><00:05:17.150><c> I</c><00:05:17.240><c> had</c><00:05:17.390><c> a</c><00:05:17.510><c> TV</c>

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 align:start position:0%
to start with just because I had a TV
 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.890 align:start position:0%
to start with just because I had a TV
titties<00:05:18.140><c> and</c><00:05:18.530><c> so</c><00:05:19.340><c> now</c><00:05:19.640><c> they're</c><00:05:20.390><c> actually</c><00:05:20.810><c> the</c>

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 align:start position:0%
titties and so now they're actually the
 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.050 align:start position:0%
titties and so now they're actually the
perfect<00:05:21.140><c> size</c><00:05:21.590><c> they're</c><00:05:22.310><c> like</c><00:05:22.520><c> not</c><00:05:22.729><c> like</c>

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 align:start position:0%
perfect size they're like not like
 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.340 align:start position:0%

they're<00:05:23.210><c> perfect</c><00:05:23.479><c> they're</c><00:05:23.780><c> not</c><00:05:23.840><c> too</c><00:05:24.169><c> big</c>

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 align:start position:0%
they're perfect they're not too big
 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.690 align:start position:0%
they're perfect they're not too big
they're<00:05:24.530><c> not</c><00:05:24.560><c> too</c><00:05:24.830><c> small</c><00:05:25.039><c> so</c><00:05:25.280><c> I</c><00:05:25.310><c> guess</c><00:05:25.490><c> they</c>

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 align:start position:0%
they're not too small so I guess they
 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.490 align:start position:0%
they're not too small so I guess they

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 align:start position:0%
will stretch out so that is something to
 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.909 align:start position:0%
will stretch out so that is something to
keep<00:05:37.940><c> in</c><00:05:38.090><c> mind</c><00:05:38.120><c> like</c><00:05:38.600><c> if</c><00:05:38.780><c> you</c><00:05:39.200><c> already</c><00:05:39.470><c> have</c>

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 align:start position:0%
quite big areolas I'm not sure if you
 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.750 align:start position:0%
quite big areolas I'm not sure if you
would<00:05:42.590><c> want</c><00:05:42.800><c> to</c><00:05:42.889><c> get</c><00:05:43.010><c> the</c><00:05:43.100><c> surgery</c><00:05:43.460><c> because</c><00:05:43.610><c> it</c>

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
would want to get the surgery because it
 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
would want to get the surgery because it
will<00:05:44.000><c> make</c><00:05:44.389><c> them</c><00:05:44.630><c> bigger</c><00:05:45.110><c> for</c><00:05:45.289><c> sure</c><00:05:45.680><c> like</c><00:05:46.190><c> a</c>

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 align:start position:0%
will make them bigger for sure like a
 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.950 align:start position:0%
will make them bigger for sure like a
hundred<00:05:46.669><c> percent</c><00:05:46.789><c> but</c><00:05:47.510><c> you</c><00:05:47.690><c> know</c><00:05:47.780><c> then</c><00:05:47.930><c> again</c>

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
hundred percent but you know then again
 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.930 align:start position:0%
hundred percent but you know then again
there's<00:05:48.260><c> nothing</c><00:05:48.620><c> wrong</c><00:05:48.830><c> with</c><00:05:49.070><c> having</c><00:05:49.220><c> bigger</c>

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with having bigger
 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.370 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with having bigger
nipples<00:05:50.389><c> or</c><00:05:50.510><c> smaller</c><00:05:50.750><c> nipples</c>

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 align:start position:0%
nipples or smaller nipples
 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.469 align:start position:0%
nipples or smaller nipples
you<00:05:51.530><c> know</c><00:05:51.650><c> a</c><00:05:51.680><c> nipple</c><00:05:52.130><c> is</c><00:05:52.190><c> a</c><00:05:52.280><c> nipple</c><00:05:52.580><c> so</c><00:05:53.000><c> don't</c>

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
you know a nipple is a nipple so don't
 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.219 align:start position:0%
you know a nipple is a nipple so don't
don't<00:05:53.870><c> worry</c><00:05:53.930><c> about</c><00:05:54.080><c> it</c>

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.620 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:05:58.160><c> basically</c><00:05:58.490><c> this</c><00:05:59.030><c> is</c><00:05:59.180><c> a</c><00:05:59.210><c> number</c><00:05:59.479><c> one</c>

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 align:start position:0%
so basically this is a number one
 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.330 align:start position:0%
so basically this is a number one
question<00:06:00.020><c> is</c><00:06:00.139><c> like</c><00:06:00.289><c> kind</c><00:06:00.500><c> of</c><00:06:00.560><c> like</c><00:06:00.620><c> what</c><00:06:01.070><c> do</c>
