00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:55.220 align:start position:0%
watching them and how they were
 

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.610 align:start position:0%
watching them and how they were

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:57.620 align:start position:0%
dedicated to their studies and so that's
 

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.370 align:start position:0%
dedicated to their studies and so that's
something<00:09:57.890><c> that</c><00:09:58.100><c> I</c><00:09:58.490><c> would</c><00:09:58.640><c> definitely</c><00:09:59.000><c> do</c><00:09:59.990><c> but</c>

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:00.380 align:start position:0%
something that I would definitely do but
 

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.250 align:start position:0%
something that I would definitely do but
I<00:10:00.440><c> also</c><00:10:00.860><c> recommend</c><00:10:01.760><c> you</c><00:10:01.850><c> learning</c><00:10:02.570><c> to</c><00:10:02.780><c> find</c><00:10:03.020><c> a</c>
