of the things so one thing that I
 

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
of the things so one thing that I

think<00:07:50.180><c> will</c><00:07:50.509><c> help</c><00:07:50.690><c> us</c><00:07:50.930><c> with</c><00:07:51.169><c> what's</c><00:07:51.469><c> the</c><00:07:51.650><c> most</c>

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
think will help us with what's the most
 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.779 align:start position:0%
think will help us with what's the most

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
difficult what's easy um did you have
anything<00:07:56.090><c> else</c><00:07:56.240><c> in</c><00:07:56.479><c> mind</c><00:07:56.659><c> that</c><00:07:56.840><c> wouldn't</c><00:07:57.080><c> be</c>

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:57.169 align:start position:0%
anything else in mind that wouldn't be
 

00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
anything else in mind that wouldn't be

00:07:58.719 --> 00:07:58.729 align:start position:0%
captured no no I think I think that's
 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:02.830 align:start position:0%

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.450 align:start position:0%
good and it's not only the difficulty of
the<00:08:02.990><c> tutorial</c><00:08:03.409><c> but</c><00:08:03.590><c> it</c><00:08:03.710><c> can</c><00:08:03.830><c> also</c><00:08:03.979><c> help</c><00:08:04.219><c> inform</c>

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:04.460 align:start position:0%
the tutorial but it can also help inform

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:12.770 align:start position:0%
it is it just difficult to use that
 

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.909 align:start position:0%
it is it just difficult to use that
would<00:08:12.919><c> be</c><00:08:13.039><c> really</c><00:08:13.279><c> useful</c><00:08:13.310><c> as</c><00:08:13.789><c> well</c><00:08:13.909><c> yeah</c><00:08:14.599><c> um</c><00:08:15.259><c> I</c>

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.030 align:start position:0%
ways of kind of educating people about
it<00:09:47.899><c> and</c><00:09:48.769><c> I</c><00:09:48.949><c> imagine</c><00:09:49.610><c> go</c><00:09:49.819><c> ipfs</c><00:09:50.300><c> has</c><00:09:50.540><c> more</c><00:09:51.040><c> more</c>

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
it and I imagine go ipfs has more more
 

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.519 align:start position:0%
it and I imagine go ipfs has more more
traffic<00:09:52.250><c> than</c><00:09:52.550><c> than</c><00:09:53.059><c> JSI</c><00:09:53.389><c> BFS</c><00:09:53.689><c> does</c><00:09:53.870><c> in</c><00:09:54.050><c> anyway</c>

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:54.529 align:start position:0%
traffic than than JSI BFS does in anyway
 

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:59.590 align:start position:0%
traffic than than JSI BFS does in anyway
so<00:09:57.009><c> that</c><00:09:58.009><c> may</c><00:09:58.129><c> be</c><00:09:58.160><c> true</c>

00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
