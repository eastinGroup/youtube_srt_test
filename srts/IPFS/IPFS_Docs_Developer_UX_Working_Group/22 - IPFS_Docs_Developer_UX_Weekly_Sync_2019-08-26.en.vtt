four of us can execute on and I have not

four of us can execute on and I have not

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
other things honestly I think what that
 

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.060 align:start position:0%
other things honestly I think what that
means<00:12:03.540><c> is</c><00:12:03.930><c> is</c><00:12:04.110><c> going</c><00:12:04.260><c> to</c><00:12:04.320><c> be</c><00:12:04.470><c> second</c><00:12:04.830><c> shift</c>

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.070 align:start position:0%
means is is going to be second shift
 

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.550 align:start position:0%
means is is going to be second shift

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
until that guy's fixed or it doesn't get
 

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.230 align:start position:0%
until that guy's fixed or it doesn't get

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:22.290 align:start position:0%
know it's important that that gets taken
 

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
know it's important that that gets taken

around<00:15:20.760><c> the</c><00:15:21.029><c> idea</c>

00:15:21.449 --> 00:15:21.459 align:start position:0%
around the idea
 

00:15:21.459 --> 00:15:23.369 align:start position:0%
around the idea
maybe<00:15:21.639><c> actually</c><00:15:22.119><c> meeting</c><00:15:22.360><c> up</c><00:15:22.569><c> in</c><00:15:22.689><c> person</c><00:15:23.110><c> and</c>

00:15:23.369 --> 00:15:23.379 align:start position:0%
maybe actually meeting up in person and
 

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:25.710 align:start position:0%
maybe actually meeting up in person and
knocking<00:15:24.040><c> this</c><00:15:24.129><c> work</c><00:15:24.369><c> out</c><00:15:24.550><c> but</c><00:15:24.879><c> whether</c><00:15:25.600><c> or</c>

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
knocking this work out but whether or
 

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
knocking this work out but whether or
not<00:15:25.899><c> that's</c><00:15:26.759><c> viable</c><00:15:27.759><c> is</c><00:15:28.139><c> kind</c><00:15:29.139><c> of</c><00:15:29.199><c> a</c><00:15:29.259><c> different</c>

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:29.529 align:start position:0%
not that's viable is kind of a different
 

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:30.929 align:start position:0%
not that's viable is kind of a different
question

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:30.939 align:start position:0%
question
 

00:15:30.939 --> 00:15:36.989 align:start position:0%
question
so<00:15:31.929><c> so</c><00:15:32.410><c> yeah</c><00:15:33.629><c> I'll</c><00:15:34.629><c> keep</c><00:15:34.899><c> on</c><00:15:35.019><c> that</c><00:15:35.790><c> but</c><00:15:36.790><c> it's</c>

00:15:36.989 --> 00:15:36.999 align:start position:0%
so so yeah I'll keep on that but it's
 

00:15:36.999 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
so so yeah I'll keep on that but it's
something<00:15:37.360><c> it's</c><00:15:37.660><c> something</c><00:15:37.749><c> I</c><00:15:38.050><c> feel</c><00:15:38.199><c> that</c><00:15:38.410><c> you</c>
