very<00:05:14.970><c> good</c><00:05:15.120><c> question</c><00:05:15.450><c> because</c><00:05:15.570><c> I</c><00:05:15.750><c> think</c>

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
very good question because I think
 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.780 align:start position:0%
very good question because I think
automation<00:05:16.650><c> is</c><00:05:16.889><c> going</c><00:05:16.979><c> to</c><00:05:17.130><c> be</c><00:05:17.220><c> an</c><00:05:17.340><c> important</c>

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 align:start position:0%
automation is going to be an important

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
potential downside is that we would then

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
have right now and we'd have various
 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.370 align:start position:0%

that<00:11:20.810><c> stew</c><00:11:21.110><c> for</c><00:11:21.290><c> a</c><00:11:21.350><c> while</c><00:11:21.500><c> while</c><00:11:21.770><c> I</c><00:11:21.800><c> can</c><00:11:23.020><c> get</c>

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:24.020 align:start position:0%
that stew for a while while I can get
 

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.290 align:start position:0%
that stew for a while while I can get
the<00:11:24.230><c> get</c><00:11:24.740><c> some</c><00:11:24.920><c> basic</c><00:11:25.370><c> implementations</c><00:11:26.060><c> and</c>

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:26.300 align:start position:0%
the get some basic implementations and
 

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.810 align:start position:0%
the get some basic implementations and
so<00:11:26.540><c> this</c><00:11:26.720><c> one</c><00:11:26.900><c> is</c><00:11:27.050><c> a</c><00:11:27.530><c> good</c><00:11:27.830><c> option</c><00:11:28.040><c> so</c><00:11:28.520><c> we</c><00:11:28.670><c> can</c>

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:28.820 align:start position:0%
so this one is a good option so we can
 

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.220 align:start position:0%
so this one is a good option so we can
we<00:11:29.090><c> can</c><00:11:29.120><c> actually</c><00:11:29.240><c> start</c><00:11:29.690><c> to</c><00:11:29.750><c> make</c><00:11:29.930><c> some</c><00:11:30.050><c> moves</c>

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:30.230 align:start position:0%
we can actually start to make some moves
 

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.780 align:start position:0%
we can actually start to make some moves
on<00:11:30.380><c> this</c><00:11:30.470><c> and</c><00:11:30.740><c> get</c><00:11:30.830><c> some</c><00:11:30.980><c> analytics</c><00:11:31.430><c> on</c><00:11:31.580><c> then</c>

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:31.790 align:start position:0%
on this and get some analytics on then
 

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:38.050 align:start position:0%
on this and get some analytics on then
that<00:11:31.910><c> can</c><00:11:32.060><c> help</c><00:11:32.210><c> us</c><00:11:32.330><c> out</c><00:11:32.450><c> so</c><00:11:36.490><c> that</c><00:11:37.490><c> is</c><00:11:37.640><c> me</c><00:11:37.850><c> in</c><00:11:37.880><c> a</c>

I cannot achieve much in a week's worth
of<00:12:20.270><c> time</c><00:12:20.420><c> then</c><00:12:20.810><c> actually</c><00:12:21.170><c> we</c><00:12:21.230><c> gonna</c><00:12:21.320><c> have</c><00:12:21.470><c> our</c>

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:21.500 align:start position:0%
of time then actually we gonna have our
 

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
of time then actually we gonna have our

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:25.850 align:start position:0%
own issues anyway so I think a protic
 

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.170 align:start position:0%
own issues anyway so I think a protic
like<00:12:26.030><c> the</c><00:12:26.180><c> the</c><00:12:26.390><c> HTTP</c><00:12:27.040><c> API</c><00:12:28.040><c> level</c><00:12:28.550><c> Docs</c><00:12:28.970><c> because</c>

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:29.180 align:start position:0%
like the the HTTP API level Docs because
 

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.900 align:start position:0%
like the the HTTP API level Docs because
they're<00:12:30.050><c> pretty</c><00:12:30.470><c> thorough</c><00:12:30.680><c> and</c><00:12:31.010><c> they're</c><00:12:31.580><c> also</c>

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:31.910 align:start position:0%
they're pretty thorough and they're also
 

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.060 align:start position:0%
they're pretty thorough and they're also
it's<00:12:32.810><c> a</c><00:12:32.870><c> very</c><00:12:33.080><c> long</c><00:12:33.260><c> page</c><00:12:33.500><c> and</c><00:12:33.800><c> it'd</c><00:12:33.860><c> be</c><00:12:33.950><c> great</c>

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:34.070 align:start position:0%
it's a very long page and it'd be great
 

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:37.570 align:start position:0%
it's a very long page and it'd be great

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:37.580 align:start position:0%
to test that searching against so yeah I
 

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
to test that searching against so yeah I

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.170 align:start position:0%
think the primary limitations is because
 

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
think the primary limitations is because
