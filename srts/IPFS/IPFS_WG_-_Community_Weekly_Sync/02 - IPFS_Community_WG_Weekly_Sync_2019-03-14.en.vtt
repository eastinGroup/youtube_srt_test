of<00:11:38.959><c> value</c><00:11:39.439><c> having</c><00:11:40.429><c> the</c><00:11:40.730><c> tutorial</c><00:11:41.360><c> and</c><00:11:41.660><c> you</c>

00:11:42.489 --> 00:11:42.499 align:start position:0%
of value having the tutorial and you
 

00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:45.609 align:start position:0%
of value having the tutorial and you
know<00:11:42.619><c> this</c><00:11:43.249><c> is</c><00:11:43.429><c> the</c><00:11:43.610><c> one</c><00:11:43.929><c> you</c><00:11:44.929><c> should</c><00:11:44.989><c> be</c><00:11:45.139><c> using</c>

00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:45.619 align:start position:0%
know this is the one you should be using
 

00:11:45.619 --> 00:11:52.269 align:start position:0%
know this is the one you should be using
so<00:11:46.929><c> do</c><00:11:47.929><c> you</c><00:11:48.019><c> mean</c><00:11:49.299><c> like</c><00:11:50.299><c> between</c><00:11:50.660><c> MF</c><00:11:51.470><c> s</c><00:11:51.679><c> and</c><00:11:52.040><c> the</c>

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
so do you mean like between MF s and the
 

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
so do you mean like between MF s and the
not<00:11:52.759><c> quite</c><00:11:53.089><c> and</c><00:11:53.360><c> my</c><00:11:53.540><c> first</c><00:11:53.749><c> things</c><00:11:54.019><c> that</c><00:11:54.139><c> are</c>

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:56.170 align:start position:0%
not quite and my first things that are
 

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:01.780 align:start position:0%
not quite and my first things that are
you<00:11:57.170><c> can</c><00:11:57.350><c> put</c><00:11:57.379><c> in</c><00:11:57.769><c> like</c><00:11:59.799><c> file</c><00:12:00.799><c> add</c><00:12:01.069><c> or</c><00:12:01.519><c> you</c><00:12:01.549><c> can</c>

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:01.790 align:start position:0%
you can put in like file add or you can
 

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.030 align:start position:0%
you can put in like file add or you can
do<00:12:01.910><c> like</c><00:12:01.939><c> MFA</c><00:12:02.600><c> you</c><00:12:02.749><c> can</c><00:12:02.899><c> create</c><00:12:03.079><c> MMS</c><00:12:03.589><c> and</c><00:12:03.739><c> my</c>

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
do like MFA you can create MMS and my
 

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.479 align:start position:0%
do like MFA you can create MMS and my
best<00:12:04.279><c> thing</c><00:12:04.549><c> and</c><00:12:04.819><c> add</c><00:12:05.509><c> things</c><00:12:05.779><c> to</c><00:12:06.139><c> it</c><00:12:06.249><c> but</c><00:12:07.249><c> then</c>

00:12:07.479 --> 00:12:07.489 align:start position:0%
best thing and add things to it but then
 

00:12:07.489 --> 00:12:11.530 align:start position:0%
best thing and add things to it but then
you<00:12:07.759><c> can</c><00:12:07.970><c> also</c><00:12:08.209><c> add</c><00:12:08.989><c> a</c><00:12:09.559><c> block</c><00:12:10.100><c> and</c><00:12:10.879><c> get</c><00:12:11.059><c> a</c><00:12:11.119><c> CID</c>

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:11.540 align:start position:0%
you can also add a block and get a CID
 

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
you can also add a block and get a CID
for<00:12:11.899><c> that</c><00:12:12.129><c> I'd</c><00:12:13.129><c> end</c><00:12:13.309><c> up</c><00:12:13.459><c> using</c><00:12:13.699><c> just</c><00:12:13.879><c> to</c><00:12:14.179><c> add</c>

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:14.329 align:start position:0%
for that I'd end up using just to add
 

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
for that I'd end up using just to add
API<00:12:14.809><c> and</c><00:12:15.259><c> then</c><00:12:15.470><c> I</c><00:12:15.709><c> but</c><00:12:16.549><c> he</c><00:12:16.639><c> doesn't</c><00:12:16.999><c> give</c><00:12:17.119><c> you</c>

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:17.209 align:start position:0%
API and then I but he doesn't give you
 

00:12:17.209 --> 00:12:19.559 align:start position:0%
API and then I but he doesn't give you
it<00:12:17.299><c> just</c><00:12:17.419><c> gives</c><00:12:17.660><c> you</c><00:12:17.749><c> back</c><00:12:18.049><c> the</c><00:12:18.350><c> multi</c><00:12:19.220><c> hash</c>

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:19.569 align:start position:0%
it just gives you back the multi hash
 

00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:22.619 align:start position:0%
it just gives you back the multi hash
but<00:12:20.569><c> it's</c><00:12:20.720><c> actually</c><00:12:21.019><c> a</c><00:12:21.049><c> multi</c><00:12:21.350><c> hash</c><00:12:21.529><c> of</c><00:12:21.829><c> a</c><00:12:21.949><c> CID</c>

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:22.629 align:start position:0%
but it's actually a multi hash of a CID
 

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:26.289 align:start position:0%
but it's actually a multi hash of a CID
so<00:12:23.629><c> then</c><00:12:23.869><c> I</c><00:12:24.199><c> wrapped</c><00:12:24.949><c> it</c><00:12:25.129><c> in</c><00:12:25.339><c> the</c><00:12:25.459><c> CID</c><00:12:25.850><c> thing</c>

00:12:26.289 --> 00:12:26.299 align:start position:0%
so then I wrapped it in the CID thing
 

00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:33.759 align:start position:0%
so then I wrapped it in the CID thing
and<00:12:26.779><c> then</c><00:12:26.959><c> gave</c><00:12:27.919><c> that</c><00:12:28.189><c> to</c><00:12:29.529><c> the</c><00:12:31.059><c> IPL</c><00:12:32.059><c> d</c><00:12:32.559><c> the</c><00:12:33.559><c> same</c>

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:33.769 align:start position:0%
and then gave that to the IPL d the same
 

00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:35.739 align:start position:0%
and then gave that to the IPL d the same
way<00:12:33.919><c> is</c><00:12:34.129><c> he's</c><00:12:34.339><c> in</c><00:12:34.489><c> the</c><00:12:34.639><c> existing</c><00:12:35.029><c> tutorial</c><00:12:35.540><c> and</c>

00:12:35.739 --> 00:12:35.749 align:start position:0%
way is he's in the existing tutorial and
 

00:12:35.749 --> 00:12:37.689 align:start position:0%
way is he's in the existing tutorial and
that<00:12:36.230><c> seemed</c><00:12:36.470><c> to</c><00:12:36.559><c> work</c><00:12:36.589><c> but</c><00:12:37.279><c> I</c><00:12:37.309><c> also</c><00:12:37.429><c> had</c><00:12:37.669><c> to</c>

00:12:37.689 --> 00:12:37.699 align:start position:0%
that seemed to work but I also had to
 

00:12:37.699 --> 00:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
that seemed to work but I also had to
convert<00:12:38.119><c> it</c><00:12:38.269><c> to</c><00:12:38.299><c> CID</c><00:12:38.749><c> version</c><00:12:39.259><c> one</c><00:12:39.410><c> so</c><00:12:40.189><c> it</c><00:12:40.459><c> was</c>

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:40.610 align:start position:0%
convert it to CID version one so it was
 

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.479 align:start position:0%
convert it to CID version one so it was
just<00:12:41.499><c> there's</c><00:12:42.499><c> a</c><00:12:42.559><c> little</c><00:12:42.709><c> puzzling</c><00:12:43.129><c> actually</c>

hour but like or an hour like sort of
 

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.690 align:start position:0%
hour but like or an hour like sort of

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
like a a streamed webinar type of thing
 

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.020 align:start position:0%
like a a streamed webinar type of thing
so<00:17:33.180><c> I</c><00:17:33.680><c> imagine</c><00:17:34.680><c> that</c><00:17:34.890><c> would</c><00:17:35.160><c> you</c><00:17:35.400><c> cover</c><00:17:35.760><c> like</c>

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.030 align:start position:0%
so I imagine that would you cover like
 

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.940 align:start position:0%
so I imagine that would you cover like
installing<00:17:36.480><c> command-line</c><00:17:37.290><c> tools</c><00:17:37.590><c> if</c><00:17:37.830><c> he</c>

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:37.950 align:start position:0%
installing command-line tools if he
 

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:44.030 align:start position:0%
installing command-line tools if he
needed<00:17:38.250><c> to</c><00:17:38.430><c> and</c><00:17:40.160><c> but</c><00:17:41.720><c> yeah</c><00:17:42.720><c> I</c><00:17:43.470><c> think</c><00:17:43.740><c> that'd</c><00:17:44.010><c> be</c>

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
needed to and but yeah I think that'd be
 

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.530 align:start position:0%
needed to and but yeah I think that'd be
good<00:17:44.250><c> thing</c><00:17:44.430><c> to</c><00:17:44.520><c> have</c><00:17:44.670><c> I</c><00:17:44.700><c> just</c><00:17:44.790><c> they</c><00:17:45.240><c> could</c><00:17:45.420><c> be</c>

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
good thing to have I just they could be
 

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:52.270 align:start position:0%
