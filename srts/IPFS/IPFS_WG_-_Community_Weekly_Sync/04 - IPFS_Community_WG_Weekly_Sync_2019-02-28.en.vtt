lately so I'm sort of looking around for

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
collaboration opportunities for showing
 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.010 align:start position:0%
collaboration opportunities for showing

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
what we can do with these collaborative
 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
what we can do with these collaborative
editing<00:03:40.500><c> environments</c><00:03:41.160><c> so</c><00:03:41.450><c> I</c><00:03:43.490><c> know</c><00:03:44.490><c> there</c>

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
editing environments so I know there
 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.250 align:start position:0%
editing environments so I know there
were<00:03:44.760><c> I</c><00:03:45.060><c> know</c><00:03:45.360><c> there</c><00:03:45.630><c> were</c><00:03:45.690><c> some</c><00:03:45.870><c> bugs</c><00:03:46.050><c> and</c>

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
were I know there were some bugs and
 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.540 align:start position:0%
were I know there were some bugs and
some<00:03:46.380><c> stability</c><00:03:46.590><c> issues</c><00:03:47.100><c> are</c><00:03:47.250><c> those</c><00:03:47.400><c> been</c>

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 align:start position:0%
some stability issues are those been
 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
some stability issues are those been
mostly<00:03:47.850><c> worked</c><00:03:48.360><c> out</c><00:03:48.540><c> at</c><00:03:48.750><c> the</c><00:03:48.870><c> pretty</c><00:03:49.080><c> stable</c>

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 align:start position:0%
mostly worked out at the pretty stable
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.580 align:start position:0%
mostly worked out at the pretty stable
now<00:03:49.760><c> it's</c><00:03:50.760><c> getting</c><00:03:51.120><c> there</c><00:03:51.300><c> I</c><00:03:51.480><c> think</c><00:03:51.630><c> it</c><00:03:51.900><c> needs</c>

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 align:start position:0%
now it's getting there I think it needs
 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.330 align:start position:0%
now it's getting there I think it needs
some<00:03:52.650><c> user</c><00:03:52.920><c> testing</c><00:03:53.660><c> it</c><00:03:54.660><c> was</c><00:03:54.780><c> a</c><00:03:54.840><c> little</c><00:03:55.050><c> bit</c><00:03:55.170><c> uh</c>

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 align:start position:0%
some user testing it was a little bit uh
 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.950 align:start position:0%
some user testing it was a little bit uh
it<00:03:56.340><c> was</c><00:03:56.460><c> a</c><00:03:56.490><c> little</c><00:03:56.730><c> unclear</c><00:03:57.060><c> on</c><00:03:57.210><c> what</c><00:03:57.420><c> the</c><00:03:57.600><c> the</c>

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
it was a little unclear on what the the
 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.810 align:start position:0%
it was a little unclear on what the the
forward<00:03:58.410><c> direction</c><00:03:58.800><c> was</c><00:03:59.010><c> for</c><00:03:59.190><c> it</c><00:03:59.310><c> because</c><00:03:59.640><c> of</c>

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
forward direction was for it because of
 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.380 align:start position:0%
forward direction was for it because of
the<00:04:00.000><c> risk</c><00:04:00.690><c> opening</c><00:04:00.930><c> exercise</c><00:04:01.970><c> but</c><00:04:02.970><c> it</c><00:04:03.150><c> seems</c>

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 align:start position:0%
the risk opening exercise but it seems
 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
the risk opening exercise but it seems
like<00:04:03.540><c> there's</c><00:04:04.040><c> the</c><00:04:05.040><c> will</c><00:04:05.250><c> to</c><00:04:05.580><c> move</c><00:04:05.940><c> forward</c>

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 align:start position:0%
like there's the will to move forward
 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.980 align:start position:0%
like there's the will to move forward
with<00:04:06.540><c> it</c><00:04:06.690><c> a</c><00:04:06.810><c> little</c><00:04:06.990><c> bit</c><00:04:07.200><c> and</c><00:04:07.850><c> also</c><00:04:08.930><c> build</c><00:04:09.930><c> some</c>

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 align:start position:0%
with it a little bit and also build some
 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.290 align:start position:0%
with it a little bit and also build some

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 align:start position:0%
around for talking of different groups
 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
around for talking of different groups
and<00:04:21.180><c> seeing</c><00:04:21.540><c> what</c><00:04:21.960><c> they</c><00:04:22.140><c> need</c><00:04:23.360><c> yeah</c><00:04:24.360><c> I</c><00:04:24.600><c> mean</c><00:04:24.780><c> my</c>

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 align:start position:0%
and seeing what they need yeah I mean my

and seeing what they need yeah I mean my
understanding<00:04:24.960><c> of</c><00:04:25.500><c> the</c><00:04:25.590><c> d</c><00:04:25.710><c> scoping</c><00:04:26.070><c> is</c><00:04:26.190><c> that</c>

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 align:start position:0%
understanding of the d scoping is that
 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.710 align:start position:0%
understanding of the d scoping is that
we're<00:04:26.550><c> not</c><00:04:26.669><c> really</c>

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
we're not really
 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.870 align:start position:0%
we're not really
we're<00:04:28.170><c> not</c><00:04:28.260><c> changing</c><00:04:28.590><c> work</c><00:04:29.070><c> items</c><00:04:29.400><c> until</c><00:04:29.700><c> next</c>

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
we're not changing work items until next

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
gonna put the idea in their head that
 

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
gonna put the idea in their head that
the<00:14:19.540><c> CRD</c><00:14:20.139><c> piece</c><00:14:20.350><c> might</c><00:14:20.949><c> be</c><00:14:21.069><c> something</c><00:14:21.370><c> that</c>

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:21.490 align:start position:0%
the CRD piece might be something that
 

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
the CRD piece might be something that

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.170 align:start position:0%
they should look into to do this in the
 

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
they should look into to do this in the
