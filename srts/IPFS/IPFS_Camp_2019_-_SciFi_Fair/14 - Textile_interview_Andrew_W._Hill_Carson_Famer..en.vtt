so<00:08:58.010><c> we</c><00:08:58.040><c> just</c><00:08:58.220><c> make</c><00:08:58.370><c> that</c><00:08:58.400><c> easy</c><00:08:58.700><c> is</c><00:08:59.000><c> out</c><00:08:59.150><c> of</c><00:08:59.270><c> the</c>

00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.330 align:start position:0%
so we just make that easy is out of the
 

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.269 align:start position:0%
so we just make that easy is out of the
box<00:08:59.540><c> and</c><00:08:59.750><c> then</c><00:08:59.870><c> we</c><00:08:59.990><c> have</c><00:09:00.140><c> this</c><00:09:00.860><c> cross-platform</c>

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
box and then we have this cross-platform
 

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
box and then we have this cross-platform
solution<00:09:02.270><c> so</c><00:09:02.480><c> it's</c>

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
solution so it's
 

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.410 align:start position:0%
solution so it's
so<00:09:05.240><c> it's</c><00:09:05.360><c> like</c><00:09:05.510><c> native</c><00:09:06.290><c> and</c><00:09:06.529><c> Android</c><00:09:06.890><c> native</c>

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:07.420 align:start position:0%
so it's like native and Android native
 

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.569 align:start position:0%
so it's like native and Android native
iOS<00:09:08.420><c> and</c><00:09:08.779><c> we</c><00:09:08.870><c> have</c><00:09:08.959><c> react</c><00:09:09.230><c> native</c><00:09:09.440><c> and</c><00:09:10.370><c> we</c><00:09:10.459><c> have</c>

it's just the key so

it's just the key so

00:10:32.729 --> 00:10:32.739 align:start position:0%
working on is how to handle
 

00:10:32.739 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
working on is how to handle

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:34.089 align:start position:0%
interoperability because the biggest
 

00:10:34.089 --> 00:10:35.939 align:start position:0%
interoperability because the biggest

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:39.730 align:start position:0%
it like you can create new things with
 

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.049 align:start position:0%
it like you can create new things with

it and so if I'm going to harvest all of
 

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
it and so if I'm going to harvest all of
