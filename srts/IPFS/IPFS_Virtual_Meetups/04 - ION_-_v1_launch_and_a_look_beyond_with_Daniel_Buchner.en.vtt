um so we'll talk a little bit about that
 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
um so we'll talk a little bit about that
how<00:00:28.560><c> that</c><00:00:28.800><c> works</c><00:00:29.119><c> as</c><00:00:29.279><c> well</c><00:00:29.439><c> as</c><00:00:29.920><c> identity</c><00:00:30.320><c> and</c>

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
how that works as well as identity and
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.429 align:start position:0%
how that works as well as identity and
iron<00:00:30.800><c> in</c><00:00:30.880><c> general</c>

first question
to<00:00:35.360><c> answer</c><00:00:35.760><c> is</c><00:00:35.840><c> what</c><00:00:36.000><c> is</c><00:00:36.160><c> identity</c><00:00:36.719><c> right</c><00:00:37.360><c> so</c>

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
to answer is what is identity right so
 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.590 align:start position:0%
to answer is what is identity right so
it's<00:00:38.320><c> sort</c><00:00:38.480><c> of</c><00:00:38.559><c> a</c><00:00:38.640><c> notoriously</c><00:00:39.280><c> difficult</c>

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 align:start position:0%

is your identity so
 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.830 align:start position:0%
is your identity so
it's<00:01:05.600><c> really</c><00:01:05.840><c> really</c><00:01:06.080><c> important</c><00:01:07.280><c> that</c><00:01:07.600><c> we</c>

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's really really important that we
 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.789 align:start position:0%
it's really really important that we
create<00:01:08.080><c> a</c><00:01:08.159><c> system</c>

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
create a system
 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.630 align:start position:0%
create a system
that<00:01:09.119><c> is</c><00:01:09.439><c> both</c><00:01:09.600><c> secure</c><00:01:10.000><c> and</c><00:01:10.080><c> decentralized</c>

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
that is both secure and decentralized
 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.990 align:start position:0%
that is both secure and decentralized
because<00:01:11.040><c> you</c><00:01:11.119><c> know</c><00:01:11.280><c> this</c><00:01:11.520><c> is</c><00:01:11.680><c> really</c>

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
because you know this is really
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.590 align:start position:0%
because you know this is really
like<00:01:12.159><c> the</c><00:01:12.320><c> story</c><00:01:12.560><c> of</c><00:01:12.640><c> your</c><00:01:12.799><c> life</c><00:01:13.280><c> right</c><00:01:14.560><c> um</c><00:01:14.880><c> so</c>

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
like the story of your life right um so
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.310 align:start position:0%
like the story of your life right um so
why<00:01:15.840><c> is</c><00:01:16.080><c> identity</c><00:01:16.640><c> a</c><00:01:16.799><c> must-win</c><00:01:17.439><c> fight</c><00:01:17.840><c> i</c><00:01:18.159><c> would</c>

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
why is identity a must-win fight i would
 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.149 align:start position:0%
why is identity a must-win fight i would
argue<00:01:18.560><c> it</c><00:01:18.640><c> is</c><00:01:18.720><c> a</c><00:01:18.799><c> must-win</c><00:01:19.280><c> fight</c>

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
argue it is a must-win fight
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.710 align:start position:0%
argue it is a must-win fight
uh<00:01:20.479><c> because</c><00:01:20.799><c> if</c><00:01:20.960><c> you</c><00:01:21.360><c> define</c><00:01:21.840><c> identity</c><00:01:22.400><c> as</c><00:01:22.560><c> the</c>

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh because if you define identity as the
 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.830 align:start position:0%
uh because if you define identity as the
thing<00:01:22.960><c> that</c><00:01:23.200><c> grounds</c>

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
