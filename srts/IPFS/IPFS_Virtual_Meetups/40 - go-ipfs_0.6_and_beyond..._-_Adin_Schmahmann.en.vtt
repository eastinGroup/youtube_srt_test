00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.230 align:start position:0%
next question what was the advantage of
 

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.900 align:start position:0%
next question what was the advantage of

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:01.910 align:start position:0%
using base 36 over base 58 the advantage
 

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
using base 36 over base 58 the advantage
was<00:12:02.120><c> that</c><00:12:02.500><c> it</c><00:12:03.500><c> is</c><00:12:03.710><c> it</c><00:12:03.950><c> can</c><00:12:04.130><c> be</c><00:12:04.220><c> represented</c><00:12:04.430><c> in</c>

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:04.970 align:start position:0%
was that it is it can be represented in
 

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
was that it is it can be represented in
either<00:12:05.150><c> lowercase</c><00:12:05.810><c> or</c><00:12:05.990><c> uppercase</c><00:12:07.210><c> and</c><00:12:08.210><c> in</c>

either lowercase or uppercase and in
 

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.850 align:start position:0%
either lowercase or uppercase and in
particular<00:12:09.470><c> the</c><00:12:10.130><c> reason</c><00:12:10.430><c> for</c><00:12:10.550><c> using</c><00:12:10.790><c> base</c><00:12:10.910><c> 36</c>

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:11.860 align:start position:0%
particular the reason for using base 36
 

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
particular the reason for using base 36
is<00:12:12.860><c> to</c><00:12:13.730><c> get</c><00:12:14.030><c> the</c><00:12:14.690><c> key</c><00:12:15.050><c> get</c><00:12:15.350><c> the</c><00:12:15.470><c> IP</c><00:12:15.650><c> and</c><00:12:15.830><c> s</c><00:12:15.950><c> keys</c>

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:16.250 align:start position:0%
is to get the key get the IP and s keys
 

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.380 align:start position:0%
is to get the key get the IP and s keys

web dot link and basically it won't do
that<00:12:31.580><c> because</c><00:12:31.910><c> it</c><00:12:32.240><c> has</c><00:12:32.360><c> both</c><00:12:32.510><c> uppercase</c><00:12:32.870><c> and</c>

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
that because it has both uppercase and
 

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
that because it has both uppercase and
