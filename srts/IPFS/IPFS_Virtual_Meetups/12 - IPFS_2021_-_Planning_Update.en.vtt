00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
pick to work on so there are of course
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.550 align:start position:0%
pick to work on so there are of course
things<00:02:23.280><c> that</c><00:02:23.520><c> are</c><00:02:23.680><c> ongoing</c>

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
things that are ongoing
 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.830 align:start position:0%
things that are ongoing
but<00:02:24.720><c> there</c><00:02:24.800><c> are</c><00:02:24.879><c> also</c><00:02:25.120><c> things</c><00:02:25.360><c> that</c><00:02:25.520><c> we</c><00:02:25.680><c> know</c>

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
but there are also things that we know

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
and uh so we've started prioritizing
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.630 align:start position:0%
and uh so we've started prioritizing
those<00:02:31.920><c> initiatives</c><00:02:32.480><c> as</c><00:02:32.560><c> well</c>

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
those initiatives as well
 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.670 align:start position:0%
those initiatives as well
and<00:02:34.720><c> then</c><00:02:35.120><c> um</c><00:02:35.519><c> as</c><00:02:35.920><c> a</c><00:02:36.000><c> part</c><00:02:36.239><c> of</c><00:02:36.400><c> this</c><00:02:36.879><c> uh</c><00:02:37.200><c> i</c><00:02:37.360><c> know</c>

and then um from there we can really
 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.990 align:start position:0%
and then um from there we can really
sift<00:05:06.400><c> through</c><00:05:06.639><c> and</c><00:05:06.720><c> determine</c><00:05:07.199><c> the</c><00:05:07.360><c> priority</c>

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
this point is
 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.110 align:start position:0%
this point is
making<00:06:50.319><c> ipfs</c><00:06:51.440><c> more</c><00:06:51.680><c> modular</c>

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
making ipfs more modular
 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.790 align:start position:0%
making ipfs more modular
so<00:06:53.360><c> that</c><00:06:53.599><c> you</c><00:06:53.759><c> can</c><00:06:55.440><c> contribute</c><00:06:56.080><c> to</c><00:06:56.319><c> parts</c>

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
so that you can contribute to parts
 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.830 align:start position:0%
so that you can contribute to parts
more<00:06:57.039><c> easily</c><00:06:57.759><c> but</c><00:06:58.000><c> also</c><00:06:58.240><c> use</c><00:06:58.560><c> parts</c><00:06:58.880><c> of</c><00:06:59.039><c> ips</c>

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
more easily but also use parts of ips
 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.909 align:start position:0%

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
bottleneck to those things
 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.589 align:start position:0%

so<00:07:58.720><c> that's</c><00:07:58.879><c> something</c><00:07:59.120><c> that</c><00:07:59.280><c> you</c><00:07:59.360><c> can</c><00:07:59.440><c> look</c>

00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
so that's something that you can look
 

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:01.909 align:start position:0%
so that's something that you can look
forward<00:08:00.000><c> to</c>

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
there are things we know we want to make
 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
there are things we know we want to make
better

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
the 2021 focus area um
 

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.149 align:start position:0%
the 2021 focus area um
so<00:08:40.800><c> we've</c><00:08:41.039><c> started</c><00:08:41.279><c> prioritizing</c><00:08:41.839><c> some</c><00:08:42.000><c> of</c>

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
so we've started prioritizing some of
 

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.070 align:start position:0%
so we've started prioritizing some of
those<00:08:42.560><c> a</c><00:08:42.640><c> lot</c><00:08:42.800><c> of</c><00:08:42.880><c> those</c><00:08:43.120><c> came</c><00:08:43.360><c> out</c><00:08:43.519><c> of</c><00:08:43.680><c> the</c>

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
those a lot of those came out of the
 

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.829 align:start position:0%
those a lot of those came out of the
uh<00:08:44.399><c> proposal</c><00:08:45.120><c> process</c><00:08:46.240><c> and</c><00:08:46.720><c> um</c>

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh proposal process and um
 

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:49.269 align:start position:0%
uh proposal process and um
so<00:08:48.000><c> that</c><00:08:48.240><c> that's</c><00:08:48.480><c> something</c><00:08:48.720><c> that</c><00:08:48.880><c> you</c><00:08:48.959><c> can</c>

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
so that that's something that you can
 

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.269 align:start position:0%
so that that's something that you can
expect<00:08:49.920><c> to</c><00:08:50.000><c> happen</c><00:08:50.240><c> regardless</c><00:08:50.880><c> of</c>

00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
expect to happen regardless of
 

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:54.550 align:start position:0%
expect to happen regardless of

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.670 align:start position:0%

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then as david said we're currently
 

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.110 align:start position:0%
and then as david said we're currently
right<00:08:57.839><c> in</c><00:08:57.920><c> the</c><00:08:58.000><c> middle</c><00:08:58.240><c> of</c><00:08:58.480><c> some</c><00:08:58.640><c> of</c><00:08:58.800><c> those</c>

00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of some of those
 

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.870 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of some of those
things

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
things
 

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.590 align:start position:0%
things
which<00:09:01.040><c> means</c><00:09:01.360><c> that</c><00:09:02.080><c> there</c><00:09:02.240><c> will</c><00:09:02.399><c> be</c><00:09:02.480><c> an</c><00:09:02.640><c> update</c>

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
which means that there will be an update
 

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.870 align:start position:0%
which means that there will be an update
and<00:09:03.760><c> hopefully</c><00:09:04.160><c> soon</c><00:09:04.480><c> but</c>

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
um the path uh that we would like to
 

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.790 align:start position:0%
um the path uh that we would like to
prioritize

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
prioritize
 

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.829 align:start position:0%

and the feedback that we have and the
 

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:22.150 align:start position:0%
and the feedback that we have and the

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.470 align:start position:0%

and<00:09:23.200><c> then</c><00:09:23.360><c> hopefully</c><00:09:23.680><c> we'll</c><00:09:23.839><c> be</c><00:09:24.000><c> able</c><00:09:24.240><c> to</c>

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully we'll be able to
 

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.150 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully we'll be able to
present<00:09:24.880><c> something</c>

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
present something
 

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.150 align:start position:0%
present something
that<00:09:26.320><c> that's</c><00:09:26.640><c> a</c><00:09:26.720><c> little</c><00:09:26.880><c> bit</c><00:09:26.959><c> more</c><00:09:27.120><c> long-term</c>

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
that that's a little bit more long-term
 

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.670 align:start position:0%
that that's a little bit more long-term
um<00:09:28.640><c> but</c><00:09:28.800><c> yeah</c><00:09:28.959><c> hopefully</c><00:09:29.360><c> that's</c><00:09:29.600><c> going</c><00:09:29.760><c> to</c><00:09:29.920><c> be</c>

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
um but yeah hopefully that's going to be
 

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
um but yeah hopefully that's going to be
our<00:09:31.839><c> next</c><00:09:34.839><c> update</c>
