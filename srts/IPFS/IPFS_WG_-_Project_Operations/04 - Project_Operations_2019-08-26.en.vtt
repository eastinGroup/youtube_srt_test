00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:07.619 align:start position:0%
in how we approach that that page itself
in<00:15:01.179><c> the</c><00:15:01.239><c> future</c><00:15:04.649><c> cool</c>

00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:07.629 align:start position:0%
in the future cool
 

00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
in the future cool
so<00:15:08.110><c> it</c><00:15:08.529><c> seems</c><00:15:08.860><c> like</c><00:15:09.160><c> we're</c><00:15:09.549><c> -</c><00:15:10.269><c> t-minus</c><00:15:10.779><c> ten</c><00:15:11.169><c> and</c>

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:11.470 align:start position:0%
so it seems like we're - t-minus ten and
 

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:17.039 align:start position:0%
so it seems like we're - t-minus ten and
