00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.090 align:start position:0%
put a lot of content to the DHT but what
 

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.610 align:start position:0%
put a lot of content to the DHT but what
this<00:17:58.420><c> does</c><00:17:58.480><c> put</c><00:17:58.750><c> a</c><00:17:58.810><c> lot</c><00:17:58.960><c> of</c><00:17:59.110><c> into</c><00:17:59.290><c> the</c><00:17:59.380><c> DHT</c>

00:17:59.610 --> 00:17:59.620 align:start position:0%
this does put a lot of into the DHT
 

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
this does put a lot of into the DHT
right<00:17:59.950><c> now</c><00:18:00.070><c> is</c><00:18:00.220><c> called</c><00:18:00.580><c> provider</c><00:18:00.910><c> records</c><00:18:01.300><c> so</c>

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:01.510 align:start position:0%
right now is called provider records so
 

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.970 align:start position:0%
right now is called provider records so
