sweet so there's the visual among us and
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.550 align:start position:0%
sweet so there's the visual among us and
then<00:00:21.720><c> we</c><00:00:21.779><c> also</c><00:00:21.900><c> have</c><00:00:22.050><c> they</c><00:00:22.170><c> everything</c><00:00:22.439><c> in</c>

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
then we also have they everything in

right so uh so really I think we talked
about<00:00:35.969><c> the</c><00:00:36.360><c> current</c><00:00:36.630><c> state</c><00:00:36.870><c> of</c><00:00:36.899><c> DHT</c><00:00:37.230><c> the</c>

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
about the current state of DHT the
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
about the current state of DHT the
example<00:00:38.040><c> that</c><00:00:38.070><c> I</c><00:00:38.460><c> certainly</c><00:00:38.700><c> well-known</c><00:00:39.480><c> know</c>

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 align:start position:0%
example that I certainly well-known know
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.049 align:start position:0%
example that I certainly well-known know

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.900 align:start position:0%
the issue about oh who's DHT and how do
you<00:00:48.390><c> scale</c><00:00:48.629><c> that</c><00:00:48.840><c> so</c><00:00:49.289><c> we</c><00:00:49.350><c> talked</c><00:00:49.530><c> about</c>

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 align:start position:0%
you scale that so we talked about
 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
you scale that so we talked about
messaging<00:00:50.910><c> protocols</c><00:00:51.899><c> as</c><00:00:52.110><c> well</c><00:00:52.140><c> as</c><00:00:52.500><c> this</c><00:00:52.829><c> idea</c>

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 align:start position:0%
messaging protocols as well as this idea
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.869 align:start position:0%
messaging protocols as well as this idea
of<00:00:54.020><c> scaling</c><00:00:55.020><c> it</c><00:00:55.289><c> right</c><00:00:56.190><c> now</c><00:00:56.309><c> with</c><00:00:56.489><c> like</c><00:00:56.610><c> peer</c>

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 align:start position:0%
of scaling it right now with like peer
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 align:start position:0%
of scaling it right now with like peer
pad<00:00:57.090><c> you're</c><00:00:57.660><c> stuck</c><00:00:57.899><c> to</c><00:00:58.109><c> maybe</c><00:00:58.440><c> scaling</c><00:00:58.859><c> to</c>

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
pad you're stuck to maybe scaling to
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.470 align:start position:0%
pad you're stuck to maybe scaling to
about<00:00:59.160><c> thirty</c><00:00:59.489><c> or</c><00:00:59.579><c> forty</c><00:00:59.940><c> maybe</c><00:01:00.059><c> a</c><00:01:00.210><c> few</c>

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
about thirty or forty maybe a few
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.930 align:start position:0%
about thirty or forty maybe a few
hundred<00:01:00.570><c> users</c><00:01:00.930><c> and</c><00:01:01.320><c> so</c><00:01:01.829><c> the</c><00:01:02.309><c> issue</c><00:01:02.430><c> also</c><00:01:02.699><c> is</c>

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
hundred users and so the issue also is
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.679 align:start position:0%
hundred users and so the issue also is
there<00:01:03.680><c> multiple</c><00:01:04.680><c> I</c><00:01:05.189><c> think</c><00:01:05.880><c> connections</c><00:01:06.479><c> so</c>

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 align:start position:0%
there multiple I think connections so
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
there multiple I think connections so
yeah<00:01:06.780><c> actually</c><00:01:06.840><c> you're</c><00:01:07.260><c> limited</c><00:01:07.590><c> by</c><00:01:07.619><c> the</c>

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 align:start position:0%
yeah actually you're limited by the
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
yeah actually you're limited by the
connection<00:01:08.460><c> connections</c><00:01:09.210><c> and</c><00:01:09.330><c> this</c><00:01:09.450><c> is</c><00:01:09.570><c> what</c>

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 align:start position:0%
connection connections and this is what
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.830 align:start position:0%
connection connections and this is what
we<00:01:09.810><c> were</c><00:01:09.869><c> talking</c><00:01:10.729><c> to</c><00:01:11.729><c> peer</c><00:01:11.970><c> about</c><00:01:12.240><c> I</c><00:01:12.420><c> think</c><00:01:12.689><c> is</c>

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
we were talking to peer about I think is
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
we were talking to peer about I think is
that<00:01:13.110><c> you</c><00:01:13.590><c> know</c><00:01:13.680><c> basically</c><00:01:13.830><c> in</c><00:01:14.189><c> right</c><00:01:14.729><c> now</c>

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 align:start position:0%
that you know basically in right now
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.830 align:start position:0%
that you know basically in right now
with<00:01:15.119><c> the</c><00:01:16.729><c> his</c><00:01:17.729><c> issue</c><00:01:18.000><c> is</c><00:01:18.180><c> that</c><00:01:18.210><c> they</c><00:01:18.390><c> limited</c>

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
with the his issue is that they limited
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
with the his issue is that they limited
to<00:01:18.960><c> about</c><00:01:19.049><c> thirty</c><00:01:19.439><c> peers</c><00:01:20.159><c> but</c><00:01:20.700><c> so</c><00:01:20.939><c> the</c><00:01:21.090><c> idea</c>

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 align:start position:0%
to about thirty peers but so the idea
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
to about thirty peers but so the idea
basically<00:01:21.479><c> taking</c><00:01:22.380><c> states</c><00:01:22.830><c> and</c><00:01:23.330><c> being</c><00:01:24.330><c> able</c>

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 align:start position:0%
basically taking states and being able
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
basically taking states and being able
to<00:01:24.920><c> report</c><00:01:25.920><c> state</c><00:01:26.310><c> as</c><00:01:26.520><c> an</c><00:01:26.729><c> IP</c><00:01:26.909><c> LD</c><00:01:27.450><c> object</c><00:01:27.990><c> and</c>

it and creating a proposed state for
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.380 align:start position:0%
it and creating a proposed state for

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 align:start position:0%
conflict resolution and and then that
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
conflict resolution and and then that
and<00:01:36.780><c> then</c><00:01:37.040><c> reported</c><00:01:38.040><c> back</c><00:01:38.189><c> as</c><00:01:38.460><c> far</c><00:01:38.610><c> as</c><00:01:38.790><c> any</c>

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 align:start position:0%

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.149 align:start position:0%
and then reported back as far as any
conflicts<00:01:39.509><c> they</c><00:01:40.140><c> also</c><00:01:40.439><c> the</c><00:01:40.590><c> idea</c><00:01:40.829><c> of</c><00:01:40.860><c> actually</c>

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
conflicts they also the idea of actually
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 align:start position:0%
conflicts they also the idea of actually
doing<00:01:41.549><c> a</c><00:01:41.759><c> calendar</c><00:01:42.180><c> hash</c><00:01:42.570><c> that</c><00:01:42.869><c> basically</c><00:01:43.259><c> if</c>

yeah and that basically got to my

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
question for Brian was Brendan is the
 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.550 align:start position:0%
question for Brian was Brendan is the

model of the data of the topology of the

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 align:start position:0%
network and so actually how do you
 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
network and so actually how do you
represent<00:05:11.030><c> that</c><00:05:11.390><c> and</c><00:05:11.690><c> to</c><00:05:11.750><c> make</c><00:05:11.870><c> sure</c><00:05:11.930><c> they</c>

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 align:start position:0%
represent that and to make sure they
 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
represent that and to make sure they
actually<00:05:12.290><c> here's</c><00:05:12.800><c> the</c><00:05:12.950><c> network</c><00:05:13.220><c> that</c><00:05:13.370><c> we're</c>

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 align:start position:0%
actually here's the network that we're
 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.620 align:start position:0%
actually here's the network that we're
trying<00:05:13.610><c> to</c><00:05:13.700><c> represent</c><00:05:13.880><c> and</c><00:05:14.300><c> here's</c><00:05:14.450><c> the</c>

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 align:start position:0%
trying to represent and here's the
 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.690 align:start position:0%
trying to represent and here's the
proposed<00:05:15.290><c> date</c><00:05:15.530><c> for</c><00:05:15.770><c> actually</c><00:05:16.070><c> the</c><00:05:16.280><c> conflict</c>

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 align:start position:0%
proposed date for actually the conflict
 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.660 align:start position:0%
proposed date for actually the conflict
resolution<00:05:17.210><c> and</c><00:05:17.420><c> at</c><00:05:18.170><c> what</c><00:05:18.350><c> time</c><00:05:18.560><c> point</c><00:05:18.800><c> and</c>

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 align:start position:0%
resolution and at what time point and
 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
resolution and at what time point and
then<00:05:19.820><c> lastly</c><00:05:20.450><c> yeah</c><00:05:20.690><c> I</c><00:05:20.720><c> guess</c><00:05:20.840><c> see</c><00:05:20.990><c> our</c><00:05:21.080><c> DTS</c><00:05:21.410><c> for</c>

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 align:start position:0%
then lastly yeah I guess see our DTS for
 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.510 align:start position:0%
then lastly yeah I guess see our DTS for
rebalancing<00:05:22.730><c> that</c><00:05:23.200><c> so</c><00:05:24.200><c> I</c><00:05:24.470><c> think</c><00:05:24.620><c> defeat</c><00:05:25.430><c> we</c>

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
rebalancing that so I think defeat we
 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.670 align:start position:0%
rebalancing that so I think defeat we
also<00:05:25.640><c> had</c><00:05:25.820><c> a</c><00:05:26.570><c> couple</c><00:05:27.080><c> different</c><00:05:27.230><c> things</c><00:05:27.440><c> you</c>

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
also had a couple different things you
 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
also had a couple different things you

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 align:start position:0%
have anything else to interject we have
 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.470 align:start position:0%

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.650 align:start position:0%
them out of the network and so it is

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:32.660 align:start position:0%

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:41.810 align:start position:0%
so I think just building upon the
 

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.750 align:start position:0%
so I think just building upon the

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
think that the D ID spec is actually
 

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
think that the D ID spec is actually

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.600 align:start position:0%

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:52.610 align:start position:0%
for creating a specification but the
 

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
for creating a specification but the

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.410 align:start position:0%
idea of basically uh yeah I have an
 

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.100 align:start position:0%
idea of basically uh yeah I have an
identity<00:12:54.740><c> and</c><00:12:55.070><c> I</c><00:12:55.160><c> have</c><00:12:55.370><c> some</c><00:12:55.640><c> nodes</c><00:12:56.570><c> that</c><00:12:56.900><c> are</c>

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
identity and I have some nodes that are
 

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%

00:12:59.560 --> 00:12:59.570 align:start position:0%
controlled under my identity that are
 

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.810 align:start position:0%
controlled under my identity that are
share<00:13:00.140><c> peers</c><00:13:00.530><c> that</c><00:13:00.800><c> so</c><00:13:01.160><c> even</c><00:13:01.580><c> though</c><00:13:01.670><c> that</c>

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:01.820 align:start position:0%
share peers that so even though that
 

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
share peers that so even though that
node<00:13:02.090><c> is</c><00:13:02.330><c> not</c><00:13:02.510><c> trusted</c><00:13:02.930><c> I'm</c><00:13:03.080><c> trusted</c><00:13:03.740><c> and</c><00:13:03.950><c> so</c>

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:04.370 align:start position:0%
node is not trusted I'm trusted and so
 

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
node is not trusted I'm trusted and so
that<00:13:04.520><c> you</c><00:13:04.640><c> can</c><00:13:04.760><c> tie</c><00:13:04.940><c> back</c><00:13:05.210><c> in</c><00:13:05.540><c> ephemeral</c><00:13:05.930><c> nodes</c>

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.170 align:start position:0%
that you can tie back in ephemeral nodes
 

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.410 align:start position:0%
that you can tie back in ephemeral nodes
actually<00:13:06.410><c> that</c><00:13:06.650><c> can</c><00:13:06.770><c> scale</c><00:13:06.980><c> up</c><00:13:07.190><c> back</c><00:13:07.460><c> to</c><00:13:07.700><c> me</c>

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:08.420 align:start position:0%
actually that can scale up back to me
 

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually that can scale up back to me
these<00:13:08.480><c> being</c><00:13:08.810><c> the</c><00:13:08.900><c> source</c><00:13:09.110><c> and</c><00:13:09.470><c> so</c><00:13:09.920><c> I</c><00:13:09.950><c> think</c>

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:11.770 align:start position:0%
these being the source and so I think
 

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:16.750 align:start position:0%
these being the source and so I think
yeah<00:13:13.060><c> rotation</c><00:13:14.060><c> identity</c><00:13:14.630><c> membership</c><00:13:15.760><c> other</c>

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.980 align:start position:0%
yeah rotation identity membership other

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:25.410 align:start position:0%
I'm still new to like dhts and and how
 

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:29.150 align:start position:0%
I'm still new to like dhts and and how
to<00:13:25.470><c> load</c><00:13:25.980><c> balance</c><00:13:26.370><c> that</c><00:13:27.769><c> but</c><00:13:28.769><c> I</c><00:13:28.800><c> think</c><00:13:29.010><c> also</c>

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
to load balance that but I think also
 

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.370 align:start position:0%
to load balance that but I think also
just<00:13:29.310><c> I</c><00:13:29.670><c> think</c><00:13:29.910><c> the</c><00:13:30.149><c> the</c><00:13:30.720><c> structured</c>

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
just I think the the structured
 

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.350 align:start position:0%
just I think the the structured

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
protocols actually the context I think
 

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.820 align:start position:0%
protocols actually the context I think
what<00:13:33.810><c> Stephen</c><00:13:34.080><c> was</c><00:13:34.170><c> mentioning</c><00:13:34.529><c> I</c><00:13:34.589><c> think</c><00:13:34.740><c> is</c>

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:34.830 align:start position:0%
what Stephen was mentioning I think is
 

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.980 align:start position:0%

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:36.990 align:start position:0%
to me this just makes sense so I suppose
 

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.630 align:start position:0%
to me this just makes sense so I suppose
the<00:13:37.560><c> other</c><00:13:37.589><c> thing</c><00:13:38.100><c> actually</c><00:13:38.459><c> I</c><00:13:38.490><c> was</c><00:13:38.610><c> thinking</c>

the other thing actually I was thinking

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
about was how did the token economics of

that as far as reputation systems and
