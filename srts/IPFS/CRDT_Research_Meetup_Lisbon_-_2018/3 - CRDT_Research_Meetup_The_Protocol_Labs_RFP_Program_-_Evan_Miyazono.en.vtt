00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 align:start position:0%
drive us in our research one of one of
 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.619 align:start position:0%
drive us in our research one of one of
those<00:01:00.180><c> and</c><00:01:00.539><c> like</c><00:01:00.899><c> this</c><00:01:01.170><c> is</c><00:01:01.289><c> obviously</c><00:01:02.070><c> not</c><00:01:02.280><c> a</c>

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 align:start position:0%
those and like this is obviously not a

those and like this is obviously not a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
highlight is that we are really
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.580 align:start position:0%
highlight is that we are really
