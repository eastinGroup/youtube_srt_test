00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:30.050 align:start position:0%
planet was carpeted with computers but
 

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.380 align:start position:0%

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:32.390 align:start position:0%
there was a also very significant shift
 

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.390 align:start position:0%
there was a also very significant shift
when<00:10:32.930><c> we</c><00:10:33.050><c> went</c><00:10:33.200><c> from</c><00:10:33.290><c> this</c><00:10:33.530><c> to</c><00:10:33.770><c> plugging</c><00:10:34.280><c> all</c>

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
when we went from this to plugging all
 

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
when we went from this to plugging all

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.050 align:start position:0%
of these computers that people now
 

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.500 align:start position:0%
of these computers that people now
suddenly<00:10:36.440><c> had</c><00:10:36.589><c> in</c><00:10:37.280><c> their</c><00:10:37.490><c> homes</c><00:10:37.670><c> or</c><00:10:37.970><c> in</c><00:10:38.030><c> their</c>

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:38.510 align:start position:0%
suddenly had in their homes or in their
 

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.170 align:start position:0%
suddenly had in their homes or in their

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:41.180 align:start position:0%

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.690 align:start position:0%
offices and so on to have them work
together<00:10:41.500><c> so</c><00:10:42.500><c> the</c><00:10:42.620><c> internet</c><00:10:42.890><c> had</c><00:10:43.130><c> this</c><00:10:43.400><c> this</c>

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:43.700 align:start position:0%

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:45.620 align:start position:0%

these different kind of networks then
 

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.090 align:start position:0%
these different kind of networks then
people<00:10:46.910><c> said</c><00:10:47.089><c> hey</c><00:10:47.210><c> what</c><00:10:47.390><c> if</c><00:10:47.450><c> these</c><00:10:47.540><c> networks</c>

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:48.100 align:start position:0%

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.530 align:start position:0%
people said hey what if these networks
work<00:10:49.100><c> we're</c><00:10:49.760><c> able</c><00:10:49.850><c> to</c><00:10:50.030><c> talk</c><00:10:50.210><c> to</c><00:10:50.300><c> each</c><00:10:50.390><c> other</c>

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:50.540 align:start position:0%
work we're able to talk to each other
 

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.579 align:start position:0%
work we're able to talk to each other
and<00:10:50.720><c> that</c><00:10:50.900><c> was</c><00:10:50.990><c> the</c><00:10:51.080><c> beginning</c><00:10:51.410><c> of</c><00:10:51.470><c> the</c>
