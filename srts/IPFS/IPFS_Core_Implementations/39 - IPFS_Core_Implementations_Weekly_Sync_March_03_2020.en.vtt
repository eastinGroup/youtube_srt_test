00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:46.430 align:start position:0%
to work around it finishing I believe
 

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
to work around it finishing I believe
like<00:08:46.550><c> the</c><00:08:46.670><c> main</c><00:08:46.880><c> dependency</c><00:08:47.330><c> we</c><00:08:47.450><c> actually</c>

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:47.810 align:start position:0%
like the main dependency we actually
 

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.290 align:start position:0%
like the main dependency we actually
have<00:08:47.990><c> is</c><00:08:48.200><c> like</c><00:08:48.350><c> okay</c><00:08:48.740><c> it's</c><00:08:48.830><c> like</c><00:08:49.180><c> that</c><00:08:50.180><c> would</c>

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:50.300 align:start position:0%
have is like okay it's like that would
 

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
have is like okay it's like that would
require<00:08:50.480><c> protocol</c><00:08:51.350><c> changes</c><00:08:51.770><c> in</c><00:08:52.130><c> the</c><00:08:52.370><c> DHD</c>

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:52.610 align:start position:0%
require protocol changes in the DHD
 

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.250 align:start position:0%
require protocol changes in the DHD
itself<00:08:53.500><c> it</c><00:08:54.500><c> would</c><00:08:54.740><c> also</c><00:08:55.010><c> require</c><00:08:55.670><c> like</c><00:08:56.300><c> the</c>

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:57.260 align:start position:0%
itself it would also require like the
 

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.020 align:start position:0%
itself it would also require like the
other<00:08:57.560><c> thing</c><00:08:57.680><c> we're</c><00:08:57.800><c> currently</c><00:08:57.950><c> using</c><00:08:58.280><c> it</c><00:08:58.580><c> for</c>

00:08:59.020 --> 00:08:59.030 align:start position:0%
other thing we're currently using it for
 

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.570 align:start position:0%
other thing we're currently using it for
events<00:08:59.990><c> they're</c><00:09:00.890><c> basically</c><00:09:01.100><c> not</c><00:09:01.280><c> wired</c><00:09:01.430><c> up</c>

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:01.580 align:start position:0%
events they're basically not wired up
 

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.210 align:start position:0%
events they're basically not wired up
yet<00:09:01.700><c> so</c><00:09:01.910><c> the</c><00:09:02.510><c> alternative</c><00:09:02.930><c> is</c><00:09:03.170><c> say</c><00:09:03.650><c> okay</c><00:09:03.920><c> we're</c>

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:04.220 align:start position:0%

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:11.570 align:start position:0%
are in some other way and then we'll
 

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
are in some other way and then we'll
plug<00:09:11.750><c> that</c><00:09:11.960><c> that's</c><00:09:12.560><c> currently</c><00:09:13.010><c> what</c><00:09:13.100><c> I'm</c>

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:13.610 align:start position:0%
plug that that's currently what I'm
 

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.610 align:start position:0%
plug that that's currently what I'm
thinking<00:09:14.450><c> of</c><00:09:14.480><c> doing</c><00:09:14.810><c> because</c><00:09:15.230><c> like</c><00:09:15.380><c> his</c><00:09:15.470><c> work</c>

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:15.620 align:start position:0%
thinking of doing because like his work
 

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.740 align:start position:0%
thinking of doing because like his work
getting<00:09:16.010><c> down</c><00:09:16.130><c> to</c><00:09:16.220><c> the</c><00:09:16.310><c> wire</c><00:09:16.340><c> here</c><00:09:16.550><c> like</c><00:09:17.360><c> seems</c>

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:17.750 align:start position:0%
getting down to the wire here like seems
 

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.450 align:start position:0%
getting down to the wire here like seems
to<00:09:17.810><c> company</c><00:09:18.050><c> be</c><00:09:18.170><c> changed</c><00:09:18.440><c> it</c><00:09:18.560><c> right</c><00:09:19.160><c> down</c><00:09:19.310><c> the</c>

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:19.460 align:start position:0%
to company be changed it right down the
 

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
to company be changed it right down the
wire<00:09:21.220><c> which</c><00:09:22.220><c> would</c><00:09:22.520><c> mean</c><00:09:22.700><c> we'd</c><00:09:22.910><c> end</c><00:09:23.060><c> up</c><00:09:23.090><c> having</c>

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:23.450 align:start position:0%
wire which would mean we'd end up having
 

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.510 align:start position:0%
wire which would mean we'd end up having
a<00:09:23.600><c> protocol</c><00:09:24.020><c> version</c><00:09:24.200><c> bump</c><00:09:24.530><c> but</c><00:09:25.280><c> it's</c><00:09:25.400><c> not</c>

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
a protocol version bump but it's not
 

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.740 align:start position:0%
a protocol version bump but it's not
going<00:09:25.700><c> to</c><00:09:25.760><c> be</c><00:09:25.820><c> a</c><00:09:25.850><c> big</c><00:09:26.090><c> issue</c><00:09:26.240><c> because</c><00:09:26.630><c> like</c>

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:26.750 align:start position:0%
going to be a big issue because like
 

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.300 align:start position:0%
going to be a big issue because like
well<00:09:27.170><c> basically</c><00:09:27.320><c> have</c><00:09:27.590><c> two</c><00:09:27.710><c> three</c><00:09:27.950><c> protocol</c>

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:28.310 align:start position:0%
well basically have two three protocol
 

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.690 align:start position:0%
well basically have two three protocol
versions<00:09:29.260><c> have</c><00:09:30.260><c> the</c><00:09:30.380><c> old</c><00:09:30.620><c> DHT</c><00:09:31.010><c> I'll</c><00:09:31.340><c> have</c><00:09:31.520><c> like</c>

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:31.700 align:start position:0%
versions have the old DHT I'll have like
 

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
versions have the old DHT I'll have like
then<00:09:32.000><c> you</c><00:09:32.090><c> will</c><00:09:32.390><c> have</c><00:09:32.480><c> the</c><00:09:32.570><c> new</c><00:09:32.660><c> DHT</c><00:09:32.960><c> which</c><00:09:32.990><c> has</c>

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.170 align:start position:0%
then you will have the new DHT which has
 

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.780 align:start position:0%
then you will have the new DHT which has
no<00:09:33.290><c> protocol</c><00:09:33.590><c> changes</c><00:09:33.890><c> but</c><00:09:34.070><c> it's</c><00:09:34.190><c> like</c><00:09:34.310><c> faster</c>

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:34.790 align:start position:0%
no protocol changes but it's like faster
 

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.610 align:start position:0%
no protocol changes but it's like faster
and<00:09:34.970><c> then</c><00:09:35.570><c> we'll</c><00:09:35.690><c> have</c><00:09:35.840><c> the</c><00:09:36.610><c> new</c><00:09:37.610><c> new</c><00:09:37.760><c> DHT</c><00:09:38.620><c> it</c>

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:39.620 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have the new new DHT it
 

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.190 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have the new new DHT it
is<00:09:40.220><c> like</c><00:09:40.550><c> has</c><00:09:40.790><c> no</c><00:09:40.940><c> like</c><00:09:41.270><c> query</c><00:09:41.960><c> launcher</c>

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
is like has no like query launcher
 

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.010 align:start position:0%
is like has no like query launcher
changes<00:09:42.560><c> but</c><00:09:42.860><c> has</c><00:09:43.010><c> the</c><00:09:43.160><c> solution</c><00:09:43.490><c> protocol</c>

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:44.020 align:start position:0%
changes but has the solution protocol
 

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
changes but has the solution protocol
but<00:09:45.020><c> I</c><00:09:45.080><c> don't</c><00:09:45.260><c> foresee</c><00:09:45.380><c> any</c><00:09:45.530><c> issues</c><00:09:45.860><c> there</c><00:09:46.450><c> so</c>

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:47.450 align:start position:0%
but I don't foresee any issues there so
 

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.940 align:start position:0%
but I don't foresee any issues there so
like<00:09:47.750><c> if</c><00:09:47.930><c> they</c><00:09:48.050><c> can't</c><00:09:48.260><c> sitting</c><00:09:48.530><c> pumped</c><00:09:48.740><c> in</c><00:09:48.830><c> and</c>

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:48.950 align:start position:0%
like if they can't sitting pumped in and
 

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.550 align:start position:0%
like if they can't sitting pumped in and
sitting<00:09:49.310><c> punted</c><00:09:49.610><c> it's</c><00:09:49.820><c> not</c><00:09:49.940><c> the</c><00:09:50.780><c> best</c><00:09:50.990><c> role</c>

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
sitting punted it's not the best role
 

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.770 align:start position:0%
sitting punted it's not the best role
but<00:09:51.830><c> it's</c><00:09:51.920><c> not</c><00:09:52.010><c> the</c><00:09:52.160><c> world's</c><00:09:52.430><c> worst</c><00:09:52.460><c> so</c><00:09:53.180><c> yeah</c>

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:53.780 align:start position:0%
but it's not the world's worst so yeah
 

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.030 align:start position:0%
but it's not the world's worst so yeah
once<00:09:54.020><c> I</c><00:09:54.050><c> talk</c><00:09:54.200><c> to</c><00:09:54.290><c> rule</c><00:09:54.440><c> about</c><00:09:54.560><c> this</c><00:09:54.740><c> later</c><00:09:54.920><c> on</c>

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:02.660 align:start position:0%
it is okay we have built the system to
 

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.210 align:start position:0%
it is okay we have built the system to
allow<00:10:02.900><c> for</c><00:10:03.110><c> upgrades</c><00:10:03.500><c> and</c><00:10:03.770><c> protocol</c>

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:04.220 align:start position:0%
allow for upgrades and protocol
 

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
allow for upgrades and protocol
purchases<00:10:04.880><c> like</c><00:10:05.060><c> I</c><00:10:05.660><c> think</c><00:10:06.080><c> a</c><00:10:06.350><c> good</c><00:10:06.500><c> direction</c>
