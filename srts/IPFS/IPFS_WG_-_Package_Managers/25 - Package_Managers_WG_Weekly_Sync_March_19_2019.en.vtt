that<00:11:24.500><c> to</c><00:11:24.589><c> myself</c><00:11:24.850><c> and</c><00:11:25.850><c> and</c><00:11:26.690><c> I</c><00:11:26.779><c> think</c><00:11:26.930><c> that'd</c><00:11:27.050><c> be</c>

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
that to myself and and I think that'd be

that to myself and and I think that'd be

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
great so I guess my point is like I
 

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.970 align:start position:0%
great so I guess my point is like I

so that's my take curious if Steve has a
 

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:55.090 align:start position:0%
so that's my take curious if Steve has a

I<00:11:55.640><c> think</c><00:11:56.420><c> I</c><00:11:56.570><c> even</c><00:11:56.900><c> more</c><00:11:57.200><c> important</c><00:11:57.470><c> to</c>

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:57.530 align:start position:0%
I think I even more important to

00:19:34.739 --> 00:19:34.749 align:start position:0%
just one layer under the surface so I
 

00:19:34.749 --> 00:19:36.209 align:start position:0%
just one layer under the surface so I
think<00:19:34.960><c> a</c><00:19:35.019><c> lot</c><00:19:35.169><c> of</c><00:19:35.200><c> that</c><00:19:35.379><c> description</c><00:19:35.679><c> came</c><00:19:36.039><c> up</c>

00:19:36.209 --> 00:19:36.219 align:start position:0%
think a lot of that description came up
 

00:19:36.219 --> 00:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
think a lot of that description came up
with<00:19:36.460><c> like</c><00:19:36.729><c> one</c><00:19:37.539><c> way</c><00:19:37.779><c> you</c><00:19:37.840><c> could</c><00:19:38.169><c> hang</c><00:19:38.379><c> a</c><00:19:38.499><c> bunch</c>

00:19:38.639 --> 00:19:38.649 align:start position:0%
with like one way you could hang a bunch
 

00:19:38.649 --> 00:19:39.989 align:start position:0%
with like one way you could hang a bunch

00:19:42.269 --> 00:19:42.279 align:start position:0%
management and I think there's a bunch
 

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
management and I think there's a bunch
of<00:19:42.399><c> different</c><00:19:42.549><c> ways</c><00:19:42.879><c> we</c><00:19:43.059><c> could</c><00:19:43.179><c> do</c><00:19:43.330><c> that</c><00:19:43.479><c> and</c><00:19:43.690><c> I</c>

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.090 align:start position:0%
of different ways we could do that and I
 

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
of different ways we could do that and I
don't<00:19:46.090><c> know</c><00:19:46.210><c> if</c><00:19:46.330><c> I</c><00:19:46.419><c> have</c><00:19:46.599><c> a</c><00:19:46.629><c> well-developed</c>

00:19:47.159 --> 00:19:47.169 align:start position:0%
don't know if I have a well-developed
 

00:19:47.169 --> 00:19:49.229 align:start position:0%
don't know if I have a well-developed

00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
framework for how to compare them if we
 

00:19:49.239 --> 00:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
framework for how to compare them if we
had<00:19:49.359><c> multiple</c><00:19:49.859><c> propositions</c><00:19:50.859><c> like</c><00:19:50.919><c> that</c><00:19:51.190><c> yet</c>

00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:51.369 align:start position:0%
had multiple propositions like that yet
 

00:19:51.369 --> 00:19:52.979 align:start position:0%
had multiple propositions like that yet
but<00:19:51.999><c> it</c><00:19:52.090><c> would</c><00:19:52.179><c> be</c><00:19:52.269><c> really</c><00:19:52.419><c> cool</c><00:19:52.629><c> if</c><00:19:52.749><c> we</c><00:19:52.869><c> came</c>

00:19:52.979 --> 00:19:52.989 align:start position:0%
but it would be really cool if we came
 

00:19:52.989 --> 00:19:53.609 align:start position:0%
but it would be really cool if we came
up<00:19:53.139><c> with</c><00:19:53.259><c> one</c>

00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:53.619 align:start position:0%
up with one
 

00:19:53.619 --> 00:19:56.999 align:start position:0%
up with one
and<00:19:54.149><c> I</c><00:19:55.149><c> think</c><00:19:55.779><c> megahertz</c><00:19:56.169><c> would</c><00:19:56.409><c> probably</c><00:19:56.889><c> be</c>

00:19:56.999 --> 00:19:57.009 align:start position:0%
and I think megahertz would probably be
 

00:19:57.009 --> 00:19:58.229 align:start position:0%
and I think megahertz would probably be

00:19:58.229 --> 00:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
