00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:43.310 align:start position:0%
for saying like well what if you already
 

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.130 align:start position:0%
for saying like well what if you already
just<00:10:43.430><c> did</c><00:10:43.760><c> one</c><00:10:43.940><c> of</c><00:10:43.970><c> these</c><00:10:44.209><c> parts</c><00:10:44.600><c> like</c><00:10:44.870><c> way</c>

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:45.140 align:start position:0%
just did one of these parts like way
 

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.030 align:start position:0%
just did one of these parts like way
what<00:10:45.950><c> does</c><00:10:46.130><c> that</c><00:10:46.160><c> open</c><00:10:46.399><c> I'm</c><00:10:47.380><c> kind</c><00:10:48.380><c> of</c><00:10:48.440><c> enable</c>

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
what does that open I'm kind of enable
 

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.550 align:start position:0%
what does that open I'm kind of enable
you<00:10:49.160><c> to</c><00:10:49.190><c> do</c><00:10:49.399><c> or</c><00:10:49.700><c> like</c><00:10:50.420><c> does</c><00:10:51.079><c> it</c><00:10:51.110><c> need</c><00:10:51.440><c> to</c><00:10:51.470><c> be</c>

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
you to do or like does it need to be
 

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
you to do or like does it need to be
linked<00:10:51.829><c> to</c><00:10:51.950><c> sometimes</c><00:10:52.399><c> yeah</c><00:10:53.000><c> yeah</c><00:10:53.149><c> and</c><00:10:53.420><c> I</c>

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
linked to sometimes yeah yeah and I
 

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.660 align:start position:0%
linked to sometimes yeah yeah and I
think<00:10:53.870><c> it</c><00:10:54.079><c> was</c><00:10:54.200><c> particularly</c><00:10:54.589><c> keying</c><00:10:55.130><c> and</c><00:10:55.399><c> on</c>

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:55.670 align:start position:0%
think it was particularly keying and on
 

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.260 align:start position:0%
think it was particularly keying and on
your<00:10:55.940><c> on</c><00:10:56.720><c> your</c><00:10:56.779><c> comments</c><00:10:57.620><c> that</c><00:10:57.829><c> we</c><00:10:58.610><c> were</c>

your on your comments that we were

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:01.370 align:start position:0%
probably going to need to do a little
 

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.310 align:start position:0%
probably going to need to do a little

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%

not lacking the technical expertise that
you<00:11:11.450><c> see</c><00:11:11.630><c> okay</c><00:11:12.290><c> so</c><00:11:12.500><c> that's</c><00:11:12.680><c> something</c><00:11:13.010><c> I'd</c>

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
you see okay so that's something I'd
 

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.069 align:start position:0%
you see okay so that's something I'd

00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
like to dig in a little bit further but
 

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
like to dig in a little bit further but
I<00:11:15.500><c> think</c><00:11:15.769><c> sort</c><00:11:15.950><c> of</c><00:11:16.010><c> my</c><00:11:16.160><c> next</c><00:11:16.430><c> steps</c><00:11:16.640><c> is</c><00:11:16.820><c> to</c><00:11:16.850><c> go</c>

00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:17.089 align:start position:0%
I think sort of my next steps is to go
 

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:19.750 align:start position:0%
I think sort of my next steps is to go

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.230 align:start position:0%
those issues and try to at least get

shake out but I think we're at that
 

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.300 align:start position:0%
shake out but I think we're at that
point<00:20:54.990><c> where</c><00:20:55.080><c> things</c><00:20:55.380><c> are</c><00:20:55.530><c> maybe</c><00:20:55.650><c> starting</c><00:20:56.100><c> to</c>

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:56.310 align:start position:0%
point where things are maybe starting to
 

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.730 align:start position:0%
point where things are maybe starting to
shake<00:20:56.520><c> out</c><00:20:56.670><c> into</c><00:20:57.120><c> more</c><00:20:57.840><c> discrete</c><00:20:58.170><c> categories</c>

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
shake out into more discrete categories
 

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
shake out into more discrete categories
so<00:20:58.950><c> I</c><00:20:59.010><c> guess</c><00:20:59.670><c> I</c><00:20:59.790><c> was</c><00:20:59.910><c> just</c><00:20:59.940><c> wondering</c><00:21:00.150><c> before</c>

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:00.450 align:start position:0%
so I guess I was just wondering before
 

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.350 align:start position:0%
so I guess I was just wondering before
we<00:21:00.750><c> went</c><00:21:00.930><c> forward</c><00:21:01.140><c> with</c><00:21:01.320><c> that</c><00:21:01.970><c> if</c><00:21:02.970><c> you</c><00:21:03.090><c> had</c><00:21:03.180><c> me</c>

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
we went forward with that if you had me
 

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
we went forward with that if you had me
anyway<00:21:05.450><c> my</c><00:21:06.450><c> initial</c><00:21:06.990><c> thought</c><00:21:07.320><c> would</c><00:21:07.560><c> be</c><00:21:07.740><c> to</c>

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:07.770 align:start position:0%
anyway my initial thought would be to
 

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
anyway my initial thought would be to
then<00:21:08.160><c> to</c><00:21:08.430><c> start</c><00:21:08.730><c> to</c><00:21:08.940><c> build</c><00:21:09.750><c> up</c><00:21:10.520><c> probably</c><00:21:11.520><c> in</c>

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:11.970 align:start position:0%
then to start to build up probably in
 

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.060 align:start position:0%
then to start to build up probably in
the<00:21:12.270><c> github</c><00:21:12.480><c> repo</c><00:21:12.990><c> but</c><00:21:13.380><c> it</c><00:21:13.470><c> would</c><00:21:13.590><c> also</c><00:21:13.740><c> work</c>

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:14.070 align:start position:0%
the github repo but it would also work
 

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.890 align:start position:0%
the github repo but it would also work
in<00:21:14.220><c> Google</c><00:21:14.340><c> Docs</c><00:21:14.670><c> to</c><00:21:14.880><c> start</c><00:21:15.420><c> building</c><00:21:15.630><c> up</c>

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
in Google Docs to start building up
 

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.850 align:start position:0%
in Google Docs to start building up
maybe<00:21:16.380><c> like</c><00:21:16.880><c> three</c><00:21:17.880><c> or</c><00:21:18.030><c> four</c><00:21:18.060><c> files</c><00:21:18.860><c> that</c>

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
maybe like three or four files that
 

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.270 align:start position:0%
maybe like three or four files that
break<00:21:20.640><c> these</c><00:21:21.210><c> things</c><00:21:21.240><c> down</c><00:21:21.540><c> into</c><00:21:22.140><c> chunks</c><00:21:22.980><c> and</c>

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
break these things down into chunks and
 

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
break these things down into chunks and
actually<00:21:23.850><c> then</c><00:21:24.140><c> four</c><00:21:25.140><c> we</c><00:21:25.770><c> have</c><00:21:25.950><c> issues</c><00:21:26.400><c> for</c>

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:26.610 align:start position:0%
actually then four we have issues for
 

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.820 align:start position:0%
actually then four we have issues for
like<00:21:26.820><c> there's</c><00:21:27.180><c> a</c><00:21:27.270><c> chunk</c><00:21:27.480><c> missing</c><00:21:27.780><c> here</c>

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:28.830 align:start position:0%
like there's a chunk missing here
 

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
like there's a chunk missing here
let's<00:21:29.700><c> go</c><00:21:29.940><c> like</c><00:21:30.300><c> either</c><00:21:31.290><c> someone</c><00:21:31.800><c> open</c><00:21:32.280><c> up</c><00:21:32.370><c> or</c>

let's go like either someone open up or

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:34.230 align:start position:0%
a quest think and like have

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:38.850 align:start position:0%
start editing it doesn't feel like we
 

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.790 align:start position:0%
start editing it doesn't feel like we

need kind of to end up with something
 

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.150 align:start position:0%
