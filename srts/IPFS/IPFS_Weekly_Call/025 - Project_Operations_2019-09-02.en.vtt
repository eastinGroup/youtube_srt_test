but I'm probably pretty difficult for

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:56.660 align:start position:0%
of these awesome tools to know that they
 

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.020 align:start position:0%
of these awesome tools to know that they

00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
exist and how they can start using them
 

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.750 align:start position:0%
exist and how they can start using them
so<00:10:59.300><c> if</c><00:11:00.290><c> possible</c><00:11:00.800><c> we</c><00:11:00.950><c> should</c><00:11:01.130><c> be</c><00:11:01.250><c> starting</c><00:11:01.520><c> to</c>

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
so if possible we should be starting to
 

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.610 align:start position:0%
so if possible we should be starting to

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:23.140 align:start position:0%
is more just about what the people think
 

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
is more just about what the people think

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:31.570 align:start position:0%

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:33.340 align:start position:0%
there might be let's just try it and
 

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.070 align:start position:0%
there might be let's just try it and

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
