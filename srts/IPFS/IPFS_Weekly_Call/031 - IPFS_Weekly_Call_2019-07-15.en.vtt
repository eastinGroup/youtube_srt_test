us that's what can cross all the

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:13.280 align:start position:0%

that so here on the screen you see the
 

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.330 align:start position:0%
that so here on the screen you see the

where<00:10:19.340><c> essentially</c><00:10:20.060><c> you</c><00:10:20.330><c> have</c><00:10:20.570><c> a</c><00:10:21.080><c> bunch</c><00:10:21.680><c> of</c>

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
where essentially you have a bunch of
 

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.850 align:start position:0%
where essentially you have a bunch of

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.290 align:start position:0%
teams slash channels on the left
they<00:10:25.220><c> have</c><00:10:25.340><c> different</c><00:10:25.520><c> sets</c><00:10:25.760><c> of</c><00:10:25.850><c> permissions</c>

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:26.300 align:start position:0%
they have different sets of permissions
 

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.780 align:start position:0%
they have different sets of permissions
so<00:10:26.630><c> you</c><00:10:26.690><c> can</c><00:10:26.900><c> have</c><00:10:27.370><c> it's</c><00:10:28.370><c> essentially</c><00:10:28.760><c> like</c>

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:28.790 align:start position:0%
so you can have it's essentially like
