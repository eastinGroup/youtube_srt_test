00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 align:start position:0%
basically do it and so my genetic
 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.589 align:start position:0%
basically do it and so my genetic

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%

actually just solve it and this is the

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:30.029 align:start position:0%
you kind of have to like assemble the
 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
you kind of have to like assemble the

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:36.069 align:start position:0%
dependency graph tray manually is this
 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:38.999 align:start position:0%

similar<00:07:36.310><c> to</c><00:07:36.490><c> are</c><00:07:36.999><c> you</c><00:07:37.150><c> basically</c><00:07:37.749><c> doing</c><00:07:38.009><c> what</c>

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:39.009 align:start position:0%
similar to are you basically doing what
 

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:41.730 align:start position:0%
similar to are you basically doing what
Jeremy<00:07:39.550><c> did</c><00:07:39.580><c> was</c><00:07:39.939><c> he</c><00:07:40.180><c> cash</c><00:07:40.419><c> um</c><00:07:41.080><c> but</c><00:07:41.680><c> you're</c>

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.740 align:start position:0%
Jeremy did was he cash um but you're
 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:48.659 align:start position:0%
Jeremy did was he cash um but you're
doing<00:07:41.949><c> it</c><00:07:42.039><c> with</c><00:07:42.099><c> etherium</c><00:07:46.770><c> but</c><00:07:47.770><c> my</c><00:07:48.159><c> guess</c><00:07:48.399><c> is</c>

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:48.669 align:start position:0%
doing it with etherium but my guess is
 

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:50.969 align:start position:0%
doing it with etherium but my guess is
yes<00:07:49.120><c> the</c><00:07:49.779><c> main</c><00:07:49.990><c> thing</c><00:07:50.229><c> that</c><00:07:50.259><c> he</c><00:07:50.469><c> did</c><00:07:50.680><c> I</c><00:07:50.830><c> mean</c>

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:50.979 align:start position:0%
yes the main thing that he did I mean
 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:53.010 align:start position:0%
yes the main thing that he did I mean
well<00:07:51.219><c> obviously</c><00:07:51.370><c> the</c><00:07:51.819><c> Z</c><00:07:51.969><c> cash</c><00:07:52.180><c> low</c><00:07:52.509><c> octane</c><00:07:52.839><c> is</c>

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.020 align:start position:0%
well obviously the Z cash low octane is
 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
well obviously the Z cash low octane is
a<00:07:53.050><c> lot</c><00:07:53.199><c> smaller</c><00:07:53.469><c> than</c><00:07:53.589><c> the</c><00:07:53.830><c> ethereum</c>

like a text file that's just like ran

00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:32.139 align:start position:0%
into this ran into that um that would be
 

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
into this ran into that um that would be

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:34.750 align:start position:0%
useful even that to tease apart and be
 

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.090 align:start position:0%
useful even that to tease apart and be

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:39.100 align:start position:0%
like how could we make it easier that
 

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
like how could we make it easier that
would<00:10:39.250><c> be</c><00:10:39.309><c> super</c><00:10:39.639><c> super</c><00:10:39.670><c> useful</c><00:10:40.379><c> yeah</c><00:10:41.790><c> also</c>

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:42.790 align:start position:0%
would be super super useful yeah also
 

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.819 align:start position:0%
would be super super useful yeah also

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:51.550 align:start position:0%
etherium objects and I'm thinking about
 

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.749 align:start position:0%
etherium objects and I'm thinking about
like<00:10:51.699><c> how</c><00:10:52.000><c> can</c><00:10:52.059><c> we</c><00:10:52.360><c> do</c><00:10:52.480><c> it</c><00:10:52.600><c> in</c><00:10:52.720><c> a</c><00:10:52.809><c> way</c><00:10:52.930><c> that</c><00:10:53.230><c> is</c>

00:10:53.749 --> 00:10:53.759 align:start position:0%
like how can we do it in a way that is
 

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
like how can we do it in a way that is
more<00:10:55.589><c> friendly</c><00:10:56.589><c> to</c><00:10:57.389><c> ipfs</c><00:10:58.389><c> and</c><00:10:58.779><c> things</c><00:10:59.500><c> like</c>

00:10:59.639 --> 00:10:59.649 align:start position:0%
more friendly to ipfs and things like
 

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:02.549 align:start position:0%
more friendly to ipfs and things like
this<00:10:59.800><c> so</c><00:11:00.100><c> like</c><00:11:01.029><c> one</c><00:11:01.269><c> example</c><00:11:01.389><c> is</c><00:11:01.809><c> our</c><00:11:01.990><c> our</c>

00:11:02.549 --> 00:11:02.559 align:start position:0%
this so like one example is our our
 

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:05.009 align:start position:0%
this so like one example is our our

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.230 align:start position:0%

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
like recurse one note at a time which is
 

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.910 align:start position:0%
like recurse one note at a time which is

experience yeah one of the hard parts is
 

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:38.530 align:start position:0%
experience yeah one of the hard parts is
just<00:11:33.440><c> getting</c><00:11:36.130><c> I</c><00:11:37.130><c> don't</c><00:11:37.730><c> people</c><00:11:37.970><c> near</c><00:11:38.269><c> awake</c>

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:38.540 align:start position:0%
just getting I don't people near awake
 

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.769 align:start position:0%
just getting I don't people near awake
at<00:11:38.750><c> the</c><00:11:38.839><c> same</c><00:11:39.019><c> time</c><00:11:39.700><c> yes</c><00:11:40.700><c> that</c><00:11:41.060><c> is</c><00:11:41.240><c> that</c><00:11:41.630><c> is</c>

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:41.779 align:start position:0%
at the same time yes that is that is
 

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
at the same time yes that is that is
certainly<00:11:42.200><c> a</c><00:11:42.290><c> challenger</c><00:11:42.860><c> in</c><00:11:42.890><c> Seattle</c><00:11:43.430><c> right</c>

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:43.610 align:start position:0%
certainly a challenger in Seattle right
 

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:44.850 align:start position:0%
certainly a challenger in Seattle right
yeah

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:44.860 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.889 align:start position:0%
yeah
so<00:11:45.860><c> you</c><00:11:45.920><c> do</c><00:11:46.490><c> roughly</c><00:11:49.360><c> yeah</c><00:11:50.360><c> but</c><00:11:50.540><c> I'm</c><00:11:50.630><c> mostly</c>

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:50.899 align:start position:0%
so you do roughly yeah but I'm mostly
 

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
so you do roughly yeah but I'm mostly
because<00:11:51.380><c> I'm</c><00:11:51.500><c> working</c><00:11:51.649><c> with</c><00:11:51.890><c> the</c><00:11:52.010><c> JavaScript</c>

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:52.490 align:start position:0%
because I'm working with the JavaScript
 

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.220 align:start position:0%
because I'm working with the JavaScript
implementations<00:11:53.149><c> I'm</c><00:11:53.360><c> mostly</c><00:11:53.660><c> like</c><00:11:54.019><c> trying</c>

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:54.230 align:start position:0%
implementations I'm mostly like trying
 

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.420 align:start position:0%
implementations I'm mostly like trying
to<00:11:54.260><c> talk</c><00:11:54.410><c> to</c><00:11:54.589><c> David</c><00:11:56.800><c> yeah</c><00:11:57.800><c> so</c><00:11:58.160><c> you're</c><00:11:58.279><c> dealing</c>
