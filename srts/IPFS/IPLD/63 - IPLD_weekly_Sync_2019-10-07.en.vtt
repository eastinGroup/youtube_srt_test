00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 align:start position:0%
case but it I think it's still a guess
 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.350 align:start position:0%
case but it I think it's still a guess
so<00:05:55.670><c> it'd</c><00:05:56.450><c> be</c><00:05:56.480><c> nice</c><00:05:56.720><c> to</c><00:05:56.900><c> have</c><00:05:57.080><c> more</c><00:05:58.150><c> more</c><00:05:59.150><c> data</c>

you<00:10:13.490><c> actually</c><00:10:13.730><c> do</c><00:10:13.819><c> have</c><00:10:13.910><c> to</c><00:10:13.999><c> pay</c><00:10:14.059><c> for</c><00:10:14.089><c> storage</c>

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:14.529 align:start position:0%
you actually do have to pay for storage
 

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
you actually do have to pay for storage
anyway<00:10:16.299><c> my</c><00:10:17.299><c> updates</c><00:10:17.629><c> yeah</c><00:10:18.319><c> so</c><00:10:18.529><c> the</c><00:10:18.679><c> the</c><00:10:19.040><c> scheme</c>

00:10:19.239 --> 00:10:19.249 align:start position:0%
anyway my updates yeah so the the scheme
 

00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:21.730 align:start position:0%
anyway my updates yeah so the the scheme
again<00:10:19.610><c> refactor</c><00:10:20.329><c> is</c><00:10:20.600><c> like</c><00:10:20.869><c> 70%</c><00:10:21.259><c> complete</c>

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:21.740 align:start position:0%
again refactor is like 70% complete
 

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.039 align:start position:0%
again refactor is like 70% complete
probably<00:10:22.220><c> seventy</c><00:10:23.179><c> eighty</c><00:10:24.279><c> which</c><00:10:25.279><c> means</c><00:10:25.549><c> that</c>

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:26.049 align:start position:0%
probably seventy eighty which means that
 

00:10:26.049 --> 00:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
probably seventy eighty which means that
UNIX<00:10:27.049><c> is</c><00:10:27.139><c> a</c><00:10:27.170><c> fee</c><00:10:27.290><c> to</c><00:10:27.319><c> is</c><00:10:27.649><c> about</c><00:10:27.769><c> 65</c><00:10:28.399><c> 70</c><00:10:28.670><c> percent</c>

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:30.189 align:start position:0%
UNIX is a fee to is about 65 70 percent
 

00:10:30.189 --> 00:10:33.970 align:start position:0%
UNIX is a fee to is about 65 70 percent
so<00:10:31.189><c> I</c><00:10:31.879><c> hope</c><00:10:32.720><c> to</c><00:10:32.929><c> have</c><00:10:33.049><c> that</c><00:10:33.110><c> finish</c><00:10:33.559><c> this</c><00:10:33.769><c> month</c>

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:33.980 align:start position:0%
so I hope to have that finish this month
 

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:41.889 align:start position:0%
so I hope to have that finish this month
actually<00:10:37.119><c> I</c><00:10:38.119><c> did</c><00:10:38.809><c> a</c><00:10:38.839><c> few</c><00:10:39.110><c> other</c><00:10:40.360><c> data</c><00:10:41.360><c> related</c>
