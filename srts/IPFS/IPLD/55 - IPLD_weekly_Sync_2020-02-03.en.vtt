was also press release about it so now
 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
was also press release about it so now
we<00:03:53.660><c> can</c><00:03:53.930><c> finally</c><00:03:54.170><c> openly</c><00:03:54.739><c> talk</c><00:03:54.950><c> about</c><00:03:55.220><c> it</c><00:03:55.370><c> in</c>

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 align:start position:0%
we can finally openly talk about it in

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
the public halls and why I mention it is
 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
the public halls and why I mention it is
because<00:03:59.150><c> icon</c><00:03:59.930><c> is</c><00:04:00.019><c> also</c><00:04:00.290><c> heavily</c><00:04:00.440><c> using</c><00:04:00.860><c> IP</c><00:04:01.280><c> LD</c>

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 align:start position:0%

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:57.430 align:start position:0%
if we could have a way for a selector to

if we could have a way for a selector to

be written that runs through a graph and

be written that runs through a graph and
then<00:11:01.810><c> says</c><00:11:02.110><c> ok</c><00:11:02.590><c> this</c><00:11:02.950><c> point</c><00:11:03.310><c> in</c><00:11:03.490><c> the</c><00:11:03.610><c> graph</c><00:11:03.820><c> is</c>

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
then says ok this point in the graph is
 

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.250 align:start position:0%
then says ok this point in the graph is
actually<00:11:04.720><c> a</c>

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:05.260 align:start position:0%

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:07.870 align:start position:0%
lecture itself go run that then we could
 

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.820 align:start position:0%

for car files a selector like it's like
 

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.570 align:start position:0%
for car files a selector like it's like
a<00:11:15.700><c> multi</c><00:11:16.060><c> selector</c><00:11:16.690><c> basically</c><00:11:17.170><c> for</c><00:11:18.130><c> all</c><00:11:18.370><c> the</c>

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:18.580 align:start position:0%
a multi selector basically for all the
 

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.470 align:start position:0%
a multi selector basically for all the

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
data inside of it
 

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
data inside of it
and<00:11:19.570><c> so</c><00:11:20.080><c> you</c><00:11:20.140><c> would</c><00:11:20.350><c> be</c><00:11:20.470><c> able</c><00:11:20.710><c> to</c><00:11:20.860><c> just</c><00:11:21.070><c> take</c>

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:21.490 align:start position:0%
and so you would be able to just take
 

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.810 align:start position:0%
and so you would be able to just take
the<00:11:21.700><c> cid</c><00:11:22.060><c> of</c><00:11:22.390><c> the</c><00:11:22.600><c> route</c><00:11:22.920><c> and</c><00:11:23.920><c> that</c><00:11:24.550><c> would</c><00:11:24.700><c> be</c>

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:24.820 align:start position:0%
the cid of the route and that would be
 

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.190 align:start position:0%
the cid of the route and that would be

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:09.910 align:start position:0%
designed that way probably Eric tends to
 

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.170 align:start position:0%
designed that way probably Eric tends to

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:13.180 align:start position:0%

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
more blocks is probably like intended
 

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.610 align:start position:0%
more blocks is probably like intended
that<00:12:15.400><c> you</c><00:12:15.490><c> can</c><00:12:15.670><c> and</c><00:12:15.910><c> and</c><00:12:16.480><c> Eric</c><00:12:17.140><c> always</c><00:12:17.440><c> has</c>

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:17.620 align:start position:0%
that you can and and Eric always has
 

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
that you can and and Eric always has

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:19.930 align:start position:0%
like this Turtles inside Turtles all the
 

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
like this Turtles inside Turtles all the

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:21.610 align:start position:0%
way down mentality about all this stuff
 

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.060 align:start position:0%
way down mentality about all this stuff
so<00:12:21.820><c> probably</c><00:12:22.270><c> thought</c><00:12:22.420><c> about</c><00:12:22.600><c> this</c><00:12:22.780><c> already</c>

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:23.070 align:start position:0%
so probably thought about this already
 

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
so probably thought about this already
but<00:12:24.070><c> yeah</c><00:12:24.280><c> we</c><00:12:25.000><c> should</c><00:12:25.210><c> spec</c><00:12:25.720><c> out</c><00:12:25.840><c> what</c><00:12:26.020><c> that</c>

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.110 align:start position:0%
but yeah we should spec out what that
 

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
but yeah we should spec out what that
looks<00:12:26.170><c> like</c><00:12:26.380><c> so</c><00:12:26.500><c> that</c><00:12:26.770><c> the</c><00:12:26.890><c> next</c><00:12:27.070><c> version</c><00:12:27.340><c> of</c>

so<00:13:19.600><c> you</c><00:13:20.110><c> store</c><00:13:20.740><c> blocks</c><00:13:20.980><c> in</c><00:13:21.130><c> it</c><00:13:21.280><c> you</c><00:13:21.430><c> tag</c><00:13:21.730><c> films</c>

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:22.150 align:start position:0%
so you store blocks in it you tag films
 

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.390 align:start position:0%
so you store blocks in it you tag films
you<00:13:22.600><c> can</c><00:13:22.810><c> compare</c><00:13:23.230><c> those</c><00:13:23.440><c> tags</c><00:13:23.740><c> you</c><00:13:23.980><c> can</c><00:13:24.040><c> sync</c>

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
you can compare those tags you can sync
 

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
you can compare those tags you can sync
those<00:13:24.580><c> tags</c><00:13:24.880><c> you</c><00:13:25.150><c> can</c><00:13:25.180><c> do</c><00:13:25.420><c> things</c><00:13:25.600><c> with</c><00:13:25.930><c> them</c>

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.010 align:start position:0%
those tags you can do things with them
 

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.170 align:start position:0%
those tags you can do things with them

things that we really wanted to give in
 

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.410 align:start position:0%
things that we really wanted to give in
like<00:13:59.590><c> a</c><00:13:59.620><c> lined</c><00:13:59.920><c> about</c><00:14:00.220><c> and</c><00:14:00.550><c> now</c><00:14:00.790><c> I</c><00:14:00.820><c> feel</c><00:14:01.390><c> like</c>

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:01.420 align:start position:0%
like a lined about and now I feel like
 

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.030 align:start position:0%
like a lined about and now I feel like

we don't have such an obvious list so
 

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.070 align:start position:0%
we don't have such an obvious list so
maybe<00:14:03.970><c> we</c><00:14:04.090><c> should</c><00:14:04.210><c> start</c><00:14:04.420><c> thinking</c><00:14:04.570><c> about</c>

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we should start thinking about
 

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.530 align:start position:0%
maybe we should start thinking about
