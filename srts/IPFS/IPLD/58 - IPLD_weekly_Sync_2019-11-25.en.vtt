00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.970 align:start position:0%
come up with any obvious improvements I

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 align:start position:0%
did that had fewer drawbacks so I think

did that had fewer drawbacks so I think

wondering whether that is is that the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 align:start position:0%
one that is that will do different
 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.370 align:start position:0%
one that is that will do different

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 align:start position:0%
versus decoding like where you have to
 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.070 align:start position:0%
versus decoding like where you have to
pre<00:04:13.430><c> allocate</c><00:04:13.790><c> the</c><00:04:13.910><c> whole</c><00:04:14.060><c> thing</c><00:04:14.330><c> and</c><00:04:14.960><c> then</c>

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
pre allocate the whole thing and then
 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
pre allocate the whole thing and then
you<00:04:15.200><c> do</c><00:04:15.549><c> the</c><00:04:16.549><c> internal</c><00:04:16.910><c> bits</c><00:04:18.100><c> yeah</c><00:04:19.100><c> yeah</c><00:04:19.880><c> and</c><00:04:20.510><c> I</c>

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 align:start position:0%
you do the internal bits yeah yeah and I
 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.610 align:start position:0%
you do the internal bits yeah yeah and I
think<00:04:20.750><c> it</c><00:04:20.989><c> is</c><00:04:21.200><c> the</c><00:04:21.380><c> case</c>

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 align:start position:0%
think it is the case
 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.010 align:start position:0%
think it is the case
that<00:04:22.090><c> the</c><00:04:23.090><c> design</c><00:04:23.360><c> is</c><00:04:23.479><c> actually</c><00:04:23.630><c> going</c><00:04:23.930><c> to</c>

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 align:start position:0%
that the design is actually going to
 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.980 align:start position:0%
that the design is actually going to

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.529 align:start position:0%
things in certain ways yep it's pretty
much<00:06:03.949><c> gonna</c><00:06:04.160><c> mean</c><00:06:04.340><c> in</c><00:06:04.520><c> practice</c><00:06:04.970><c> lists</c><00:06:05.389><c> only</c>

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 align:start position:0%
much gonna mean in practice lists only
 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:12.040 align:start position:0%

support<00:06:06.199><c> linear</c><00:06:06.530><c> appending</c><00:06:06.979><c> which</c><00:06:07.370><c> is</c><00:06:11.050><c> just</c>

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 align:start position:0%
support linear appending which is just
 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.230 align:start position:0%
support linear appending which is just
like<00:06:12.169><c> so</c><00:06:12.289><c> I'm</c><00:06:12.349><c> kind</c><00:06:12.590><c> of</c><00:06:12.669><c> yeah</c><00:06:13.669><c> it's</c><00:06:14.000><c> not</c><00:06:14.120><c> the</c>

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
like so I'm kind of yeah it's not the
 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
like so I'm kind of yeah it's not the
worst<00:06:14.449><c> but</c><00:06:14.660><c> it's</c><00:06:14.840><c> a</c><00:06:14.870><c> bit</c><00:06:14.990><c> like</c><00:06:16.120><c> so</c><00:06:17.120><c> some</c><00:06:17.300><c> of</c><00:06:17.389><c> the</c>

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 align:start position:0%
worst but it's a bit like so some of the
 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:18.850 align:start position:0%
worst but it's a bit like so some of the
methods<00:06:17.780><c> that</c><00:06:17.840><c> are</c><00:06:17.990><c> currently</c><00:06:18.320><c> on</c><00:06:18.470><c> there</c><00:06:18.620><c> for</c>

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 align:start position:0%
methods that are currently on there for
 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.779 align:start position:0%
methods that are currently on there for
like<00:06:18.889><c> set</c><00:06:19.550><c> at</c><00:06:19.870><c> arbitrary</c><00:06:20.870><c> index</c><00:06:21.410><c> I'm</c><00:06:22.130><c> thinking</c>

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 align:start position:0%
like set at arbitrary index I'm thinking
 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.129 align:start position:0%
like set at arbitrary index I'm thinking
it<00:06:22.940><c> might</c><00:06:23.060><c> actually</c><00:06:23.240><c> make</c><00:06:23.510><c> more</c><00:06:23.780><c> sense</c><00:06:23.990><c> to</c>

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 align:start position:0%
it might actually make more sense to
 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.810 align:start position:0%
it might actually make more sense to
just<00:06:24.260><c> drop</c><00:06:24.530><c> support</c><00:06:24.949><c> for</c><00:06:25.190><c> those</c><00:06:25.280><c> because</c><00:06:25.729><c> if</c>

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 align:start position:0%
just drop support for those because if
 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.250 align:start position:0%
just drop support for those because if
that's<00:06:25.970><c> going</c><00:06:26.150><c> to</c><00:06:26.210><c> end</c><00:06:26.360><c> up</c><00:06:26.449><c> being</c><00:06:26.660><c> conditional</c>

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 align:start position:0%
that's going to end up being conditional
 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.589 align:start position:0%
that's going to end up being conditional
and<00:06:27.349><c> twist</c><00:06:27.650><c> even</c><00:06:28.060><c> you</c><00:06:29.060><c> might</c><00:06:29.240><c> as</c><00:06:29.300><c> well</c><00:06:29.360><c> just</c>

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
and twist even you might as well just
 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.070 align:start position:0%
and twist even you might as well just
not<00:06:29.659><c> have</c><00:06:29.960><c> them</c><00:06:31.270><c> if</c><00:06:32.270><c> it's</c><00:06:32.479><c> limited</c><00:06:32.900><c> to</c><00:06:33.050><c> a</c>

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
not have them if it's limited to a
 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.590 align:start position:0%
not have them if it's limited to a

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
single block anyway it's and
 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.660 align:start position:0%

it<00:06:35.780><c> is</c><00:06:35.900><c> pretty</c><00:06:36.170><c> rare</c><00:06:36.350><c> didn't</c><00:06:36.620><c> to</c><00:06:36.740><c> do</c><00:06:36.890><c> that</c><00:06:37.070><c> just</c>

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 align:start position:0%
it is pretty rare didn't to do that just
 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.090 align:start position:0%
it is pretty rare didn't to do that just
copying<00:06:38.120><c> the</c><00:06:38.330><c> entire</c><00:06:38.420><c> data</c><00:06:38.900><c> structure</c><00:06:39.350><c> could</c>

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 align:start position:0%
copying the entire data structure could
 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.070 align:start position:0%
copying the entire data structure could

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
offer you the same thing in the rare
 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
offer you the same thing in the rare
case<00:06:42.290><c> that</c><00:06:42.470><c> you</c><00:06:42.530><c> need</c><00:06:42.680><c> it</c><00:06:49.540><c> yeah</c><00:06:50.540><c> na</c><00:06:50.870><c> meaning</c>

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170 align:start position:0%
case that you need it yeah na meaning
 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.310 align:start position:0%
case that you need it yeah na meaning
that<00:06:51.290><c> they</c><00:06:51.740><c> suck</c><00:06:52.130><c> for</c><00:06:52.670><c> advanced</c><00:06:53.150><c> layouts</c><00:06:53.510><c> it</c>

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
that they suck for advanced layouts it
 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.770 align:start position:0%
that they suck for advanced layouts it
is<00:06:54.620><c> actually</c><00:06:55.160><c> still</c><00:06:55.220><c> a</c><00:06:55.430><c> concern</c><00:06:55.880><c> so</c><00:06:56.540><c> it</c>

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 align:start position:0%
is actually still a concern so it
 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
is actually still a concern so it
advanced<00:06:57.140><c> player</c><00:06:57.320><c> through</c><00:06:57.590><c> their</c><00:06:57.740><c> own</c><00:06:57.890><c> thing</c>

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
advanced player through their own thing
 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.500 align:start position:0%
advanced player through their own thing
though<00:06:58.340><c> like</c><00:06:58.580><c> advanced</c><00:06:58.880><c> layout</c><00:06:59.060><c> tab</c><00:06:59.330><c> like</c>

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 align:start position:0%
though like advanced layout tab like
 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.450 align:start position:0%
though like advanced layout tab like
whatever<00:06:59.870><c> can</c><00:07:00.710><c> watch</c><00:07:00.830><c> it</c><00:07:00.980><c> than</c><00:07:01.070><c> anything</c><00:07:01.220><c> else</c>

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 align:start position:0%
whatever can watch it than anything else
 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.470 align:start position:0%
whatever can watch it than anything else
right<00:07:01.720><c> and</c><00:07:02.720><c> and</c><00:07:03.610><c> yeah</c><00:07:04.610><c> I</c><00:07:04.640><c> had</c><00:07:05.210><c> like</c><00:07:05.240><c> what</c>

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
right and and yeah I had like what
 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.580 align:start position:0%
right and and yeah I had like what
you've<00:07:05.600><c> got</c><00:07:05.720><c> to</c><00:07:05.810><c> worry</c><00:07:05.960><c> about</c><00:07:06.140><c> it</c><00:07:06.290><c> I</c><00:07:06.350><c> like</c><00:07:06.500><c> the</c>

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 align:start position:0%
you've got to worry about it I like the
 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.380 align:start position:0%
you've got to worry about it I like the
micro<00:07:06.830><c> optimizations</c><00:07:06.950><c> layer</c><00:07:07.640><c> it's</c><00:07:07.880><c> just</c><00:07:08.120><c> like</c>

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.390 align:start position:0%
micro optimizations layer it's just like
 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.060 align:start position:0%
micro optimizations layer it's just like
you<00:07:08.840><c> know</c><00:07:08.930><c> the</c><00:07:09.080><c> common</c><00:07:09.410><c> operations</c><00:07:09.920><c> that</c>

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 align:start position:0%
you know the common operations that
 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.350 align:start position:0%
you know the common operations that
people<00:07:10.250><c> are</c><00:07:10.310><c> gonna</c><00:07:10.430><c> do</c><00:07:10.640><c> in</c><00:07:10.850><c> a</c><00:07:10.910><c> single</c><00:07:11.180><c> block</c>

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
people are gonna do in a single block
 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.290 align:start position:0%
people are gonna do in a single block
right<00:07:14.440><c> today</c><00:07:15.580><c> so</c><00:07:16.580><c> like</c><00:07:16.730><c> I</c><00:07:16.850><c> wouldn't</c><00:07:17.090><c> want</c><00:07:17.240><c> to</c>

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 align:start position:0%
right today so like I wouldn't want to
 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
right today so like I wouldn't want to
stop<00:07:17.720><c> offering</c><00:07:18.290><c> the</c><00:07:18.440><c> interface</c><00:07:18.830><c> method</c><00:07:19.280><c> for</c><00:07:19.550><c> a</c>

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690 align:start position:0%
stop offering the interface method for a
 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.530 align:start position:0%
stop offering the interface method for a
setback<00:07:20.690><c> in</c><00:07:21.140><c> thigh</c><00:07:22.090><c> right</c><00:07:23.090><c> great</c><00:07:23.270><c> but</c><00:07:23.450><c> when</c>

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540 align:start position:0%
setback in thigh right great but when
 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
setback in thigh right great but when
you<00:07:23.630><c> do</c><00:07:23.750><c> that</c><00:07:23.930><c> in</c><00:07:24.080><c> the</c><00:07:24.140><c> implementation</c><00:07:24.350><c> just</c>

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 align:start position:0%
you do that in the implementation just
 

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.610 align:start position:0%
you do that in the implementation just
copy<00:07:25.340><c> it</c><00:07:25.490><c> if</c><00:07:25.640><c> you</c><00:07:25.730><c> don't</c><00:07:25.850><c> want</c><00:07:25.970><c> this</c><00:07:26.030><c> if</c><00:07:26.420><c> you</c><00:07:26.620><c> it</c>

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 align:start position:0%
copy it if you don't want this if you it
 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
copy it if you don't want this if you it
like<00:07:27.950><c> yeah</c><00:07:28.720><c> just</c><00:07:29.720><c> do</c><00:07:29.780><c> a</c><00:07:29.840><c> full</c><00:07:30.050><c> copy</c><00:07:30.230><c> in</c><00:07:30.590><c> order</c>

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:30.890 align:start position:0%
like yeah just do a full copy in order
 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.290 align:start position:0%
like yeah just do a full copy in order
to<00:07:31.010><c> get</c><00:07:31.130><c> it</c><00:07:31.250><c> out</c><00:07:31.340><c> if</c><00:07:31.670><c> you</c><00:07:31.880><c> can't</c><00:07:32.090><c> do</c><00:07:32.210><c> the</c>

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 align:start position:0%
to get it out if you can't do the
 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.330 align:start position:0%
to get it out if you can't do the
operation<00:07:32.680><c> any</c><00:07:33.680><c> other</c><00:07:33.860><c> way</c><00:07:36.100><c> there</c><00:07:37.100><c> are</c><00:07:37.220><c> other</c>

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:37.340 align:start position:0%
operation any other way there are other
 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.820 align:start position:0%
operation any other way there are other
reasons<00:07:37.520><c> that</c><00:07:37.820><c> won't</c><00:07:38.060><c> work</c><00:07:38.180><c> but</c><00:07:38.710><c> probably</c><00:07:39.710><c> I</c>

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 align:start position:0%
reasons that won't work but probably I
 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.370 align:start position:0%
reasons that won't work but probably I
don't<00:07:40.010><c> read</c><00:07:40.580><c> it</c><00:07:40.700><c> yeah</c><00:07:41.600><c> explain</c><00:07:42.110><c> it</c><00:07:42.230><c> right</c><00:07:42.320><c> now</c>

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380 align:start position:0%
don't read it yeah explain it right now

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:52.610 align:start position:0%
it or basically I come to the
 

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.550 align:start position:0%
it or basically I come to the

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
realization that so there would be just
 

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.710 align:start position:0%
realization that so there would be just
assuming<00:11:56.130><c> more</c><00:11:56.760><c> of</c><00:11:56.970><c> another</c><00:11:57.450><c> layer</c><00:11:57.600><c> of</c>

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
assuming more of another layer of
 

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.170 align:start position:0%
assuming more of another layer of

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
indirection so it isn't too bad to use
 

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.570 align:start position:0%
indirection so it isn't too bad to use
it<00:12:00.360><c> it</c><00:12:01.170><c> might</c><00:12:01.440><c> still</c><00:12:01.770><c> make</c><00:12:01.800><c> sense</c><00:12:02.130><c> the</c><00:12:02.430><c> future</c>

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
it it might still make sense the future
 

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.130 align:start position:0%

to<00:12:02.850><c> kind</c><00:12:03.060><c> of</c><00:12:03.090><c> like</c><00:12:03.360><c> have</c><00:12:03.570><c> an</c><00:12:03.690><c> adapter</c><00:12:04.110><c> for</c>

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
to kind of like have an adapter for

to kind of like have an adapter for

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
server supported formats as well but I
 

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.660 align:start position:0%
server supported formats as well but I
will<00:12:07.110><c> probably</c><00:12:07.710><c> just</c><00:12:08.070><c> move</c><00:12:08.250><c> on</c><00:12:08.460><c> without</c>

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:08.670 align:start position:0%
will probably just move on without
 

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
will probably just move on without
survey<00:12:09.510><c> and</c><00:12:09.660><c> use</c><00:12:09.780><c> the</c><00:12:09.990><c> Seaboard</c><00:12:10.970><c> positively</c>

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:13.490 align:start position:0%

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.810 align:start position:0%

yeah<00:12:14.490><c> I</c><00:12:15.380><c> had</c><00:12:16.380><c> a</c><00:12:16.410><c> quick</c><00:12:16.650><c> top</c><00:12:17.340><c> of</c><00:12:17.490><c> Stephen</c><00:12:17.760><c> about</c>

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I had a quick top of Stephen about
 

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I had a quick top of Stephen about
that<00:12:18.090><c> and</c><00:12:18.360><c> we</c><00:12:19.260><c> kind</c><00:12:19.350><c> of</c><00:12:19.440><c> realized</c><00:12:19.710><c> it</c><00:12:19.860><c> like</c>

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.010 align:start position:0%
that and we kind of realized it like
 

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.010 align:start position:0%
that and we kind of realized it like
it's<00:12:20.700><c> actually</c><00:12:20.970><c> really</c><00:12:21.090><c> easy</c><00:12:21.210><c> for</c><00:12:21.660><c> all</c><00:12:21.810><c> the</c>

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's actually really easy for all the
 

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's actually really easy for all the
stuff<00:12:22.260><c> to</c><00:12:22.530><c> support</c><00:12:22.740><c> third</c><00:12:23.430><c> a</c><00:12:23.580><c> to</c><00:12:23.640><c> one</c>

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.090 align:start position:0%
stuff to support third a to one
 

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
stuff to support third a to one
direction<00:12:24.570><c> only</c><00:12:24.780><c> right</c><00:12:25.320><c> like</c><00:12:25.500><c> you</c><00:12:25.590><c> can</c><00:12:25.740><c> add</c>

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:25.890 align:start position:0%
direction only right like you can add
 

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.430 align:start position:0%
direction only right like you can add
the<00:12:26.070><c> sir</c><00:12:26.220><c> date</c><00:12:26.400><c> rates</c><00:12:26.640><c> to</c><00:12:27.390><c> all</c><00:12:27.750><c> the</c><00:12:27.840><c> itlp</c><00:12:28.110><c> stuff</c>

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
the sir date rates to all the itlp stuff
 

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.900 align:start position:0%
the sir date rates to all the itlp stuff
so<00:12:28.620><c> it</c><00:12:28.710><c> works</c><00:12:28.890><c> like</c><00:12:29.130><c> as</c><00:12:29.340><c> goodness</c><00:12:29.640><c> are</c><00:12:29.820><c> they</c>

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:29.910 align:start position:0%
so it works like as goodness are they
 

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.060 align:start position:0%
so it works like as goodness are they
can<00:12:30.150><c> support</c><00:12:30.480><c> even</c><00:12:31.050><c> if</c><00:12:31.230><c> we</c><00:12:31.380><c> didn't</c><00:12:31.590><c> use</c><00:12:31.770><c> survey</c>

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.070 align:start position:0%
can support even if we didn't use survey
 

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.110 align:start position:0%
can support even if we didn't use survey
as<00:12:32.190><c> like</c><00:12:32.340><c> the</c><00:12:32.460><c> core</c><00:12:32.730><c> thing</c><00:12:34.490><c> yes</c><00:12:35.490><c> but</c><00:12:35.730><c> I</c><00:12:35.820><c> tell</c>

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:01.230 align:start position:0%
ended up kind of deferring that whole
 

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.749 align:start position:0%
ended up kind of deferring that whole

00:15:05.359 --> 00:15:05.369 align:start position:0%
maybe stuff as well because that turned
 

00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:07.129 align:start position:0%
maybe stuff as well because that turned

00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
out to be entangled with all this so
 

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:11.569 align:start position:0%
out to be entangled with all this so
that's<00:15:07.350><c> gonna</c><00:15:07.499><c> come</c><00:15:07.709><c> back</c><00:15:07.860><c> after</c><00:15:08.189><c> that</c><00:15:10.549><c> but</c><00:15:11.549><c> a</c>

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:36.380 align:start position:0%

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:43.430 align:start position:0%
to do and I hope most of the questions
 

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.050 align:start position:0%
to do and I hope most of the questions
are<00:15:43.790><c> resolved</c><00:15:44.180><c> except</c><00:15:44.660><c> then</c><00:15:44.780><c> maybe</c><00:15:44.930><c> ones</c><00:15:46.060><c> okay</c>

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:47.060 align:start position:0%
are resolved except then maybe ones okay
 

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.970 align:start position:0%
are resolved except then maybe ones okay
so<00:15:47.570><c> are</c><00:15:47.840><c> you</c><00:15:47.930><c> saying</c><00:15:48.110><c> fluids</c><00:15:48.530><c> gonna</c><00:15:48.740><c> be</c><00:15:48.860><c> the</c>

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:48.980 align:start position:0%
so are you saying fluids gonna be the
 

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.500 align:start position:0%
so are you saying fluids gonna be the
only<00:15:49.130><c> way</c><00:15:49.340><c> to</c><00:15:49.400><c> do</c><00:15:49.640><c> this</c><00:15:52.060><c> as</c><00:15:53.060><c> far</c><00:15:53.270><c> as</c><00:15:53.390><c> I</c><00:15:53.450><c> can</c>

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:53.510 align:start position:0%
only way to do this as far as I can
 

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:59.050 align:start position:0%

figure<00:15:53.810><c> out</c><00:15:53.930><c> yes</c><00:15:55.390><c> okay</c><00:15:57.640><c> some</c><00:15:58.640><c> of</c><00:15:58.700><c> the</c><00:15:58.790><c> earlier</c>

00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.060 align:start position:0%
figure out yes okay some of the earlier
 

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
figure out yes okay some of the earlier

some strokes with exported fields that
 

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.950 align:start position:0%
some strokes with exported fields that

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:12.110 align:start position:0%
actually see obvious ways to do that and
 

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.850 align:start position:0%
actually see obvious ways to do that and

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:14.860 align:start position:0%
get the correct like memory efficiency
