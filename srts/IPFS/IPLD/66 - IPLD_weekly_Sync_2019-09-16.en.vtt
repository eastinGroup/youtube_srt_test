it's getting that syntax merge so I'm
 

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.050 align:start position:0%
it's getting that syntax merge so I'm
actually<00:07:52.070><c> wondering</c><00:07:52.400><c> whether</c><00:07:52.730><c> there's</c><00:07:53.000><c> a</c>

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:39.830 align:start position:0%
they're using aliases so type alias is

would be a nice thing to get to this
week<00:09:12.959><c> yeah</c><00:09:17.160><c> and</c><00:09:18.160><c> yeah</c><00:09:18.399><c> I</c><00:09:18.459><c> think</c><00:09:18.749><c> that's</c><00:09:19.749><c> right</c>

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.110 align:start position:0%

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.379 align:start position:0%
week yeah and yeah I think that's right
I<00:09:20.249><c> was</c><00:09:21.249><c> just</c><00:09:21.369><c> gonna</c><00:09:21.459><c> say</c><00:09:21.699><c> like</c><00:09:21.910><c> the</c><00:09:22.089><c> events</c>

00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:22.389 align:start position:0%
I was just gonna say like the events
 

00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:23.999 align:start position:0%
I was just gonna say like the events
layouts<00:09:22.689><c> is</c><00:09:22.929><c> the</c><00:09:23.110><c> last</c><00:09:23.679><c> thing</c><00:09:23.889><c> that's</c>

00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:24.009 align:start position:0%
layouts is the last thing that's
 

00:09:24.009 --> 00:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
layouts is the last thing that's
blocking<00:09:24.189><c> me</c><00:09:24.489><c> actually</c>

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:24.970 align:start position:0%
blocking me actually
 

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
blocking me actually
so<00:09:25.209><c> I</c><00:09:25.809><c> mean</c><00:09:26.350><c> aliases</c><00:09:26.889><c> like</c><00:09:27.129><c> once</c><00:09:27.790><c> they're</c><00:09:27.999><c> in</c>

00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:28.209 align:start position:0%
so I mean aliases like once they're in
 

00:09:28.209 --> 00:09:29.999 align:start position:0%
so I mean aliases like once they're in
I'll<00:09:28.569><c> probably</c><00:09:28.809><c> use</c><00:09:29.139><c> them</c><00:09:29.319><c> at</c><00:09:29.589><c> some</c><00:09:29.739><c> point</c><00:09:29.949><c> of</c>

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:30.009 align:start position:0%
I'll probably use them at some point of
 

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:31.559 align:start position:0%
I'll probably use them at some point of
time<00:09:30.069><c> but</c><00:09:30.519><c> there's</c><00:09:30.730><c> actually</c><00:09:30.999><c> like</c><00:09:31.149><c> a</c><00:09:31.179><c> lot</c><00:09:31.420><c> of</c>

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:31.569 align:start position:0%
time but there's actually like a lot of
 

00:09:31.569 --> 00:09:33.749 align:start position:0%
time but there's actually like a lot of

00:09:33.749 --> 00:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
updates they'll have to make to the to
 

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:35.879 align:start position:0%
updates they'll have to make to the to

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:35.889 align:start position:0%
my schema gen stuff won't aliases land
 

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
my schema gen stuff won't aliases land
because<00:09:36.369><c> right</c><00:09:36.910><c> now</c><00:09:37.089><c> I'm</c><00:09:37.449><c> speaking</c><00:09:37.959><c> to</c><00:09:38.110><c> Erik's</c>

Michael sorry yeah I'm totally okay with
that<00:10:58.239><c> changing</c><00:10:58.600><c> rating</c><00:10:58.839><c> that's</c><00:10:59.049><c> right</c>

00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.410 align:start position:0%
that changing rating that's right
 

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.609 align:start position:0%
that changing rating that's right
yeah<00:11:00.779><c> that</c><00:11:01.779><c> would</c><00:11:01.869><c> give</c><00:11:02.049><c> some</c><00:11:02.230><c> breathing</c><00:11:02.559><c> room</c>

00:11:02.609 --> 00:11:02.619 align:start position:0%
yeah that would give some breathing room
 

00:11:02.619 --> 00:11:04.429 align:start position:0%
yeah that would give some breathing room
so<00:11:02.889><c> we</c><00:11:03.009><c> don't</c><00:11:03.039><c> rush</c><00:11:03.399><c> something</c><00:11:03.850><c> through</c><00:11:03.999><c> that</c>

00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
so we don't rush something through that
 

00:11:04.439 --> 00:11:06.819 align:start position:0%
so we don't rush something through that
we<00:11:05.439><c> might</c><00:11:05.649><c> end</c><00:11:05.769><c> up</c><00:11:05.829><c> regretting</c>

00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:06.829 align:start position:0%
we might end up regretting
 

00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:09.109 align:start position:0%
we might end up regretting
not<00:11:07.829><c> but</c><00:11:08.100><c> not</c><00:11:08.459><c> that</c><00:11:08.610><c> it's</c><00:11:08.730><c> a</c><00:11:08.790><c> big</c><00:11:08.939><c> deal</c><00:11:08.970><c> to</c>

00:11:09.109 --> 00:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
not but not that it's a big deal to
 

00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:10.780 align:start position:0%
not but not that it's a big deal to
change<00:11:09.540><c> these</c><00:11:09.689><c> things</c><00:11:09.749><c> right</c><00:11:10.110><c> now</c><00:11:10.259><c> we</c><00:11:10.319><c> don't</c>

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:10.790 align:start position:0%
change these things right now we don't
 

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.970 align:start position:0%
change these things right now we don't
know<00:11:11.790><c> with</c><00:11:12.720><c> any</c><00:11:12.899><c> consumers</c><00:11:13.350><c> of</c><00:11:13.470><c> this</c><00:11:13.589><c> stuff</c><00:11:13.799><c> so</c>

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
know with any consumers of this stuff so
 

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.129 align:start position:0%
know with any consumers of this stuff so
it's<00:11:14.129><c> not</c><00:11:14.249><c> so</c><00:11:14.910><c> breaking</c><00:11:15.269><c> changes</c><00:11:15.629><c> and</c><00:11:15.779><c> not</c><00:11:15.899><c> the</c>

00:11:16.129 --> 00:11:16.139 align:start position:0%
it's not so breaking changes and not the
 

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's not so breaking changes and not the
worst<00:11:17.029><c> but</c><00:11:18.029><c> it'll</c><00:11:18.569><c> be</c><00:11:18.660><c> good</c><00:11:18.749><c> to</c><00:11:18.899><c> get</c><00:11:18.989><c> this</c><00:11:19.079><c> one</c>

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:19.290 align:start position:0%
worst but it'll be good to get this one
 

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.579 align:start position:0%
worst but it'll be good to get this one
run<00:11:21.079><c> yeah</c><00:11:22.079><c> I</c><00:11:22.110><c> guess</c>

00:11:22.579 --> 00:11:22.589 align:start position:0%
run yeah I guess
 

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
run yeah I guess
as<00:11:22.920><c> far</c><00:11:23.129><c> as</c><00:11:23.160><c> breaking</c><00:11:23.610><c> changes</c><00:11:24.029><c> go</c><00:11:24.209><c> this</c><00:11:24.480><c> seems</c>

00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:24.689 align:start position:0%
as far as breaking changes go this seems
 

00:11:24.689 --> 00:11:26.419 align:start position:0%
as far as breaking changes go this seems
like<00:11:24.749><c> one</c><00:11:25.110><c> of</c><00:11:25.199><c> the</c><00:11:25.350><c> less</c><00:11:25.559><c> scary</c><00:11:25.889><c> places</c><00:11:26.279><c> to</c>

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:26.429 align:start position:0%
like one of the less scary places to
 

00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:29.359 align:start position:0%
like one of the less scary places to
have<00:11:26.549><c> show</c><00:11:26.819><c> up</c><00:11:26.999><c> it</c><00:11:27.689><c> doesn't</c><00:11:28.110><c> have</c><00:11:29.040><c> a</c><00:11:29.069><c> splash</c>

00:11:29.359 --> 00:11:29.369 align:start position:0%
have show up it doesn't have a splash
 

00:11:29.369 --> 00:11:32.869 align:start position:0%
have show up it doesn't have a splash
radius<00:11:29.639><c> that's</c><00:11:30.029><c> any</c><00:11:30.209><c> bigger</c><00:11:30.420><c> than</c><00:11:30.600><c> itself</c><00:11:31.879><c> and</c>

00:11:32.869 --> 00:11:32.879 align:start position:0%
radius that's any bigger than itself and
 

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:36.229 align:start position:0%
radius that's any bigger than itself and
so<00:11:34.279><c> yeah</c><00:11:35.279><c> I</c><00:11:35.309><c> think</c><00:11:35.369><c> I</c><00:11:35.610><c> do</c><00:11:35.759><c> like</c><00:11:36.029><c> pretty</c>

00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think I do like pretty
 

00:11:36.239 --> 00:11:44.569 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think I do like pretty
mornings<00:11:40.639><c> I</c><00:11:41.639><c> should</c><00:11:42.209><c> note</c><00:11:42.749><c> that</c><00:11:42.779><c> in</c><00:11:43.110><c> here</c><00:11:43.579><c> I'll</c>

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
mornings I should note that in here I'll
 

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.509 align:start position:0%
mornings I should note that in here I'll
go<00:11:44.730><c> back</c><00:11:44.879><c> to</c><00:11:44.999><c> that</c><00:11:45.059><c> when</c><00:11:45.269><c> I'm</c><00:11:45.360><c> done</c><00:11:46.259><c> speaking</c>

00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
go back to that when I'm done speaking
 

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:49.789 align:start position:0%
go back to that when I'm done speaking
so<00:11:47.519><c> the</c><00:11:47.670><c> last</c><00:11:47.819><c> thing</c><00:11:48.029><c> was</c><00:11:48.209><c> this</c><00:11:49.110><c> progress</c><00:11:49.470><c> 1</c>

00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:49.799 align:start position:0%
so the last thing was this progress 1
 

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:51.710 align:start position:0%
so the last thing was this progress 1
line<00:11:49.980><c> 2</c><00:11:50.009><c> which</c><00:11:50.399><c> is</c><00:11:50.549><c> a</c><00:11:50.579><c> distillation</c><00:11:51.059><c> of</c><00:11:51.299><c> 180</c>

00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
to make progress on that but I still
 

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:09.139 align:start position:0%
to make progress on that but I still

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:51.270 align:start position:0%
the emulation one trip in public so he

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:03.150 align:start position:0%
what it looks like now but it's great
 

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.650 align:start position:0%
what it looks like now but it's great
actually

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
actually
 

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
actually
yeah<00:17:07.280><c> it's</c><00:17:08.280><c> simpler</c><00:17:08.790><c> than</c><00:17:08.970><c> a</c><00:17:09.030><c> regex</c><00:17:09.270><c> it's</c>

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it's simpler than a regex it's
 

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.270 align:start position:0%
yeah it's simpler than a regex it's
literally<00:17:09.870><c> like</c><00:17:10.110><c> a</c><00:17:10.170><c> generator</c><00:17:10.740><c> that</c><00:17:10.829><c> like</c>

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
literally like a generator that like
 

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.350 align:start position:0%
literally like a generator that like
looks<00:17:11.610><c> for</c><00:17:11.820><c> the</c><00:17:11.910><c> next</c><00:17:12.180><c> index</c><00:17:12.510><c> of</c><00:17:12.750><c> the</c><00:17:12.959><c> string</c>

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
looks for the next index of the string
 

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:24.380 align:start position:0%
looks for the next index of the string
markdown<00:17:15.360><c> it's</c><00:17:15.600><c> all</c><00:17:15.660><c> utf-8</c><00:17:23.060><c> saying</c><00:17:24.060><c> something</c>

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:24.390 align:start position:0%
markdown it's all utf-8 saying something
 

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
markdown it's all utf-8 saying something
awesome<00:17:24.690><c> I</c><00:17:24.780><c> can</c><00:17:24.930><c> tell</c><00:17:25.110><c> but</c><00:17:25.350><c> no</c><00:17:25.680><c> no</c><00:17:25.829><c> it's</c><00:17:26.040><c> the</c><00:17:26.160><c> so</c>

yeah Michael mutters initial version
 

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
yeah Michael mutters initial version
just<00:17:28.530><c> stripped</c><00:17:29.250><c> them</c><00:17:29.400><c> out</c><00:17:29.520><c> and</c><00:17:29.700><c> and</c><00:17:29.970><c> then</c>

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.170 align:start position:0%
just stripped them out and and then
 

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.810 align:start position:0%
just stripped them out and and then
treated<00:17:31.170><c> each</c><00:17:31.290><c> block</c><00:17:31.830><c> as</c><00:17:32.010><c> a</c><00:17:32.040><c> different</c><00:17:32.520><c> part</c>

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
treated each block as a different part
 

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.630 align:start position:0%
treated each block as a different part

keeps carrying on with that same kind of

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
your mahkum yeah because they would not
 

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
your mahkum yeah because they would not

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:14.330 align:start position:0%
rewrite any of the markdown lines and
 

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:20.020 align:start position:0%
rewrite any of the markdown lines and
just<00:20:14.420><c> rewrite</c><00:20:14.810><c> the</c><00:20:14.930><c> code</c><00:20:15.080><c> blocks</c><00:20:18.670><c> with</c><00:20:19.670><c> my</c><00:20:19.820><c> go</c>

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:20.030 align:start position:0%
just rewrite the code blocks with my go
 

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:28.990 align:start position:0%
just rewrite the code blocks with my go
programmers<00:20:20.540><c> happy</c><00:20:20.780><c> at</c><00:20:20.870><c> least</c><00:20:27.790><c> maybe</c><00:20:28.790><c> that</c>

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:33.470 align:start position:0%
would still be a bit harder yeah the

would still be a bit harder yeah the

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.090 align:start position:0%
tricky bit there is that you would lose
