00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 align:start position:0%
to build for unit tests so yeah that's
 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.659 align:start position:0%
to build for unit tests so yeah that's
in<00:06:08.669><c> some</c><00:06:09.530><c> experiments</c><00:06:10.530><c> there</c><00:06:10.860><c> and</c><00:06:11.070><c> also</c><00:06:11.160><c> some</c>

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:19.310 align:start position:0%
where workers have like no debugging
 

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.010 align:start position:0%
where workers have like no debugging
it's<00:10:20.310><c> like</c><00:10:20.520><c> it</c><00:10:21.000><c> either</c><00:10:21.120><c> works</c><00:10:21.450><c> or</c><00:10:21.690><c> it</c><00:10:21.750><c> doesn't</c>

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's like it either works or it doesn't
 

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's like it either works or it doesn't
and<00:10:22.260><c> if</c><00:10:22.410><c> you</c><00:10:22.529><c> want</c><00:10:22.709><c> to</c><00:10:22.770><c> debug</c><00:10:22.950><c> something</c><00:10:23.130><c> you</c>

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.370 align:start position:0%
and if you want to debug something you
 

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
and if you want to debug something you
have<00:10:23.459><c> to</c><00:10:23.550><c> like</c><00:10:23.670><c> put</c><00:10:23.910><c> it</c><00:10:24.000><c> in</c><00:10:24.120><c> the</c><00:10:24.209><c> response</c><00:10:24.570><c> body</c>

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:24.810 align:start position:0%
have to like put it in the response body
 

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.810 align:start position:0%
have to like put it in the response body
so<00:10:25.470><c> that's</c><00:10:25.649><c> been</c><00:10:25.890><c> really</c><00:10:26.130><c> fun</c><00:10:26.250><c> to</c><00:10:26.640><c> work</c><00:10:26.760><c> with</c>

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
so that's been really fun to work with
 

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.569 align:start position:0%
so that's been really fun to work with
development<00:10:27.810><c> but</c><00:10:28.200><c> um</c><00:10:28.350><c> it's</c><00:10:28.709><c> it's</c><00:10:29.070><c> been</c><00:10:29.310><c> really</c>

00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:29.579 align:start position:0%
development but um it's it's been really
 

00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
development but um it's it's been really

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.850 align:start position:0%
in a lot of our documentation and then

we've realized love those separations in

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.110 align:start position:0%
don't have our kind of code layers so

00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:38.819 align:start position:0%
should just look at and just decide to
 

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:41.779 align:start position:0%
should just look at and just decide to

00:13:46.249 --> 00:13:46.259 align:start position:0%
not changing it we should probably just
 

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
not changing it we should probably just
mark<00:13:46.619><c> it</c><00:13:51.409><c> and</c><00:13:52.409><c> then</c><00:13:52.469><c> yeah</c><00:13:53.189><c> and</c><00:13:53.219><c> like</c><00:13:53.909><c> because</c>

00:13:54.319 --> 00:13:54.329 align:start position:0%
mark it and then yeah and like because
 

00:13:54.329 --> 00:13:55.699 align:start position:0%
mark it and then yeah and like because
it<00:13:54.449><c> does</c><00:13:54.749><c> get</c><00:13:54.869><c> a</c><00:13:54.959><c> bit</c><00:13:54.989><c> confusing</c><00:13:55.409><c> trying</c><00:13:55.559><c> to</c>

00:13:55.699 --> 00:13:55.709 align:start position:0%
it does get a bit confusing trying to
 

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:57.879 align:start position:0%
it does get a bit confusing trying to

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:57.889 align:start position:0%
build on top because there's so many oh
 

00:13:57.889 --> 00:14:00.949 align:start position:0%
build on top because there's so many oh
yeah<00:13:58.889><c> but</c><00:13:59.339><c> I</c><00:13:59.369><c> get</c><00:13:59.609><c> like</c><00:13:59.969><c> I</c><00:14:00.089><c> guess</c><00:14:00.269><c> I</c><00:14:00.449><c> would</c><00:14:00.659><c> so</c><00:14:00.929><c> I</c>

00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
yeah but I get like I guess I would so I
 

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:05.349 align:start position:0%
yeah but I get like I guess I would so I
would<00:14:01.229><c> probably</c><00:14:01.499><c> do</c><00:14:01.679><c> it</c><00:14:01.829><c> first</c><00:14:02.429><c> do</c><00:14:02.879><c> an</c><00:14:03.439><c> async</c>

00:14:05.349 --> 00:14:05.359 align:start position:0%
would probably do it first do an async
 

00:14:05.359 --> 00:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
would probably do it first do an async

00:14:08.119 --> 00:14:08.129 align:start position:0%
run through the specs so I can totally
 

00:14:08.129 --> 00:14:10.009 align:start position:0%
run through the specs so I can totally
do<00:14:08.189><c> it</c><00:14:08.219><c> I</c><00:14:08.399><c> bet</c><00:14:08.549><c> he's</c><00:14:08.669><c> so</c><00:14:08.789><c> busy</c><00:14:08.999><c> it</c><00:14:09.299><c> upon</c><00:14:09.749><c> me</c><00:14:09.869><c> of</c><00:14:09.929><c> a</c>

00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
do it I bet he's so busy it upon me of a
 

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:12.709 align:start position:0%
do it I bet he's so busy it upon me of a

00:14:12.709 --> 00:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
comment saying okay like this is what I
 

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:14.269 align:start position:0%
comment saying okay like this is what I
think<00:14:12.809><c> should</c><00:14:13.139><c> happen</c><00:14:13.199><c> and</c><00:14:13.739><c> then</c><00:14:13.889><c> we</c><00:14:13.979><c> can</c><00:14:14.099><c> just</c>

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
think should happen and then we can just
 

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
think should happen and then we can just
quickly<00:14:14.459><c> decide</c><00:14:14.819><c> okay</c><00:14:15.119><c> you</c><00:14:15.599><c> do</c><00:14:15.749><c> we</c><00:14:15.989><c> don't</c><00:14:16.169><c> do</c>

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:16.289 align:start position:0%
quickly decide okay you do we don't do

it emerge that be chosen whatever I

00:14:28.699 --> 00:14:28.709 align:start position:0%
out and get it done get emerged I think
 

00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:30.769 align:start position:0%
out and get it done get emerged I think
there's<00:14:28.859><c> a</c><00:14:29.009><c> few</c><00:14:29.369><c> other</c><00:14:29.579><c> Piazza</c><00:14:29.969><c> regions</c><00:14:30.569><c> can</c>

there's a few other Piazza regions can

do it as synchronous Vegas look like
 

00:14:38.839 --> 00:14:43.969 align:start position:0%
do it as synchronous Vegas look like

00:14:58.999 --> 00:14:59.009 align:start position:0%
rod can't be and and what if we if we do
 

00:14:59.009 --> 00:15:03.049 align:start position:0%
rod can't be and and what if we if we do
it<00:14:59.099><c> for</c><00:14:59.609><c> example</c><00:15:00.119><c> like</c><00:15:00.529><c> next</c><00:15:01.529><c> week</c><00:15:01.849><c> instead</c><00:15:02.849><c> of</c>

it for example like next week instead of

00:15:06.229 --> 00:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
quickly after this meeting or like I
 

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:09.049 align:start position:0%
quickly after this meeting or like I

00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
know that works for me I think that'd be
