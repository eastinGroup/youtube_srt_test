00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
for us lamb there is prototype for it
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
for us lamb there is prototype for it
which<00:00:57.840><c> is</c><00:00:58.050><c> linked</c><00:00:58.379><c> in</c><00:00:58.440><c> the</c><00:00:58.500><c> notes</c><00:00:58.710><c> and</c><00:00:59.690><c> but</c><00:01:00.690><c> it</c>

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 align:start position:0%
which is linked in the notes and but it
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.509 align:start position:0%
which is linked in the notes and but it
needs<00:01:01.129><c> a</c><00:01:02.129><c> special</c><00:01:02.640><c> version</c><00:01:03.510><c> of</c><00:01:03.690><c> the</c><00:01:04.339><c> sieve</c><00:01:05.339><c> of</c>

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 align:start position:0%

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 align:start position:0%

Arzo which probably won't be merged
upstream<00:01:09.600><c> so</c><00:01:10.170><c> it's</c><00:01:10.350><c> just</c><00:01:10.530><c> yes</c><00:01:11.040><c> I</c><00:01:11.070><c> said</c><00:01:11.250><c> a</c>

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
upstream so it's just yes I said a
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.990 align:start position:0%
upstream so it's just yes I said a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 align:start position:0%

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 align:start position:0%
that's something we need for the

that's something we need for the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
Seabourn coding stuff and therefore you
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
Seabourn coding stuff and therefore you
need<00:01:40.829><c> to</c><00:01:40.890><c> heck</c><00:01:41.130><c> it</c><00:01:41.250><c> into</c><00:01:41.520><c> the</c><00:01:41.990><c> library</c><00:01:42.990><c> itself</c>

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 align:start position:0%
need to heck it into the library itself
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.670 align:start position:0%
need to heck it into the library itself
which<00:01:44.159><c> is</c><00:01:44.340><c> a</c><00:01:44.369><c> good</c><00:01:44.579><c> solution</c><00:01:44.729><c> so</c><00:01:45.450><c> I</c><00:01:45.750><c> will</c><00:01:46.470><c> try</c>

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
which is a good solution so I will try
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.609 align:start position:0%
which is a good solution so I will try
next<00:01:47.100><c> to</c><00:01:47.720><c> convince</c><00:01:48.720><c> the</c><00:01:48.899><c> people</c><00:01:49.020><c> from</c><00:01:49.259><c> Shirley</c>

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
next to convince the people from Shirley
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.940 align:start position:0%
next to convince the people from Shirley
to<00:01:49.979><c> actually</c><00:01:50.670><c> implement</c><00:01:51.090><c> tech</c><00:01:51.420><c> support</c><00:01:51.950><c> and</c>

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 align:start position:0%
to actually implement tech support and
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.190 align:start position:0%
to actually implement tech support and
we'll<00:01:53.399><c> see</c><00:01:53.640><c> how</c><00:01:53.729><c> this</c><00:01:53.880><c> goes</c><00:01:56.329><c> yeah</c><00:01:57.329><c> that's</c><00:01:57.600><c> all</c>

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 align:start position:0%

there's<00:13:51.670><c> no</c><00:13:51.820><c> implementation</c><00:13:52.390><c> for</c><00:13:52.480><c> you</c><00:13:52.570><c> like</c>

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.410 align:start position:0%
there's no implementation for you like

00:13:58.079 --> 00:13:58.089 align:start position:0%
implementation so at the moment you I
 

00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
implementation so at the moment you I
mean<00:13:58.180><c> you</c><00:13:58.390><c> can</c><00:13:58.540><c> use</c><00:13:58.690><c> the</c><00:13:58.839><c> own</c><00:13:58.959><c> stuff</c><00:14:00.240><c> yeah</c><00:14:01.240><c> so</c>

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:01.630 align:start position:0%
mean you can use the own stuff yeah so
 

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
mean you can use the own stuff yeah so
it<00:14:01.800><c> depends</c><00:14:02.800><c> on</c><00:14:02.890><c> who</c><00:14:03.550><c> we</c><00:14:03.700><c> mean</c><00:14:03.970><c> by</c><00:14:04.740><c> like</c><00:14:05.740><c> the</c>

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:05.890 align:start position:0%
it depends on who we mean by like the
 

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.970 align:start position:0%
it depends on who we mean by like the
audience<00:14:06.339><c> for</c><00:14:06.579><c> this</c><00:14:06.730><c> is</c><00:14:06.880><c> very</c><00:14:07.089><c> broad</c><00:14:07.329><c> right</c><00:14:07.570><c> so</c>

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
audience for this is very broad right so
 

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.130 align:start position:0%
audience for this is very broad right so
like<00:14:08.980><c> we</c><00:14:09.850><c> could</c><00:14:10.120><c> write</c><00:14:10.329><c> better</c><00:14:10.540><c> documentation</c>

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:11.140 align:start position:0%
