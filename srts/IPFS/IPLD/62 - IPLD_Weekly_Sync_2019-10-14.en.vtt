well I learned some new things about how
the<00:04:35.670><c> compiler</c><00:04:36.000><c> optimizes</c><00:04:36.780><c> memory</c><00:04:37.110><c> usage</c>

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 align:start position:0%
the compiler optimizes memory usage
 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.530 align:start position:0%
the compiler optimizes memory usage
recently<00:04:37.980><c> for</c><00:04:38.490><c> example</c><00:04:38.520><c> if</c><00:04:38.940><c> I</c><00:04:39.030><c> have</c><00:04:39.180><c> like</c><00:04:39.360><c> this</c>

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 align:start position:0%

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
recently for example if I have like this

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 align:start position:0%
pointers sometimes the compiler will
 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.150 align:start position:0%
pointers sometimes the compiler will

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
amortize that whole thing until one move
 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.430 align:start position:0%

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 align:start position:0%

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
